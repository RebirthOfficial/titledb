You can play as one (or two, in 2-player mode) of the students, competing against the others. You must prepare for the upcoming end of the century, earn enough money, and generally manage your life well. This is a Monopoly-like board game, only instead of dices you use cards. The characters are represented by small cars on a city map. The number that appears on the card you pull from the deck represents the amount of squares your car can move on the map. Each square leads to a different event: accident, romantic meeting, promotion, etc. Some of the events allow you to make an additional choice. For example, if you land in a casino, you'll be asked if you want to gamble. Answering \"yes\" will lead to a slot machine mini-game.",

Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school  furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors).\n\nNightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted \"real world,\" players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a \"sleep meter\" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted \"dream world,\" where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained.\n\nPlayers can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become \"Dream Warriors\" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared.\n\nNightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.",

All this is achieved through playing (alone, vs. computer, or in two-, three-, and four-player mode) a board game in which you take your hero through a series of fields. Unlike most similar games, the amount of fields you can advance is not determined by a dice roll, but by a moving power meter that you must stop at the right time in order to jump the desired amount of fields. Needless to say that those fields have very different effects on the participants. There are different stats (like stamina, charisma, etc.) that can be increased or reduced if you step on a particular field. For example, you might end up on a \"eating\" field, which will take you to a friend who will invite you to a dinner. This will result in increased weight, a parameter that will affect your future performance.",

Furthermore, should a zombie hostage fall out a window he can rescue them to slowly power up his attacks.\n\nThe game is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player can control Namakubi's movement across the screen and the ability to shoot.

However, lately monsters began settling in it, gradually turning whole districts into ruins. Only New Phlan remained under human control, but its inhabitants are afraid to venture into the monster-infested areas. In order to clean the nearby Barren River and rebuild Phlan, local authorities spread rumors about alleged riches hidden somewhere in the city. A party of adventurers, attracted by these news, sails towards Phlan and accepts the quest. \n \nPool of Radiance is the first adaptation of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons role-playing system in a computer game format. In the beginning of the game the player can use a pre-made party of six characters or create each of them from scratch. Six races (human, elf, dwarf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) and four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief) are available. The player can tweak the attributes of the characters and assign a moral alignment to each one. \n \nExploration of the town and hostile areas (dungeons) is viewed from a first-person perspective in a pseudo-3D world. Enemy encounters are random and take place on separate isometric combat screens, where player-controlled party and enemies take turns fighting each other. Experience points are awarded for defeating enemies, and characters level up after having accumulated set amounts. Fighters gain more attacks, thieves become proficient in backstabbing, while clerics and wizards can memorize more spells to cast before they need to rest. Non-human characters can also \"multi-class\" (learn the abilities of another class) when leveling up. \n \nThe NES version was substantially different from other versions. It removed references to the Adventure's Journal and some of the more complex features of the computer versions, like different currency units. Battles were significantly reduced in size, the graphics were overhauled and redesigned so that the game could be controlled with a control pad, and music was written for it. A randomly generated dungeon feature was also removed.",

The stranded people on the island are: Gilligan and the Skipper ( the crew of the ship), a millionaire and his wife, a professor, and Mariann who is a homely Midwest U.S.A. girl.\n\nDespite the name, you'll be playing as the Skipper. Gilligan follows you around as a comedic relief sidekick. The game is divided into four episodes; the goal is always to locate all crew members in a limited amount of time. To do so the two heroes have to navigate the maze-like island and collect items - every found character provides hints for the next step.\n\nThere are also a lot of dangers which have to be faced: wild animals and headhunters can be fought with your bare hands and fallen rocks or obstacles on the ground have to be avoided. A common nuisance are holes in the ground which lead to the underground caves: Gilligan is likely to fall into these. If this happens Skipper has two minutes to get Gilligan back. There are three items which help Skipper on his quest: bananas replenish his health, hourglasses give extra time and the rope is used to get Gilligan back instantly.",

You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...\n\nThe game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the \"examine\" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.",

Citizens who had banished the Belmont family now beg for Trevor Belmont's help in slaying Dracula. In his strange castle, Dracula has been assembling a massive army of undead creatures to sweep the Earth clean of life and bring everlasting darkness. Trevor agrees to help and equips his family's hereditary whip, the \"Vampire Slayer\", in order to destroy Dracula. \n \nCastlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay is nearly identical to the first Castlevania game. The player takes the role of Trevor Belmont who is able to move left and right, jump, attack with his whip straight ahead and use a special weapon. These special weapons consume hearts, which can be found by defeating monsters or destroying candles. Power-ups include: a throwing dagger, a throwing axe, A time-stopping stopwatch, a cross-shaped boomerang and a vial of holy water. Additionally there is a double shot (II) and triple shot (III) power-up which increases the number of special weapons that can be used at one time. Trevor is defeated if his life meter runs out, and can find a roast turkey power-up to replenish it. Trevor progresses through each level defeating monsters and eventually encountering a boss creature. At different points in the game the player will be able to chose between different paths, which will determine which levels are played. \n \nAt the end of certain levels, the player may encounter a companion which can be recruited. Only one companion can accompany Trevor at any time; accepting a new companion means rejecting the existing one. Once recruited, Trevor can change between his own form and that of the companion. Each companion has an independent life meter and has unique abilities such as powerful magic, the ability to climb walls or flight. These abilities may also affect the types of power-ups that appear in candles and the exact function of special weapons.",

Gameplay is an arcade style platform game with six levels, each with a variety of creatures and a large boss at the end. When you destroy an enemy, a power up will sometimes be left behind. Collecting these can give you extra points, an extra life, more ammo, or a mega key. If you have enough points and collect a mega key, you then have the ability to transform into Megagon. In this form, you are larger in size, can jump further, and have increased strength. You start the transformation with an amount of mega points; each time a creature injures you, points are lost. When all of the mega points are gone you will transform back into your normal size.",

The participants' responses are timed. \n \nIn the story mode, you can navigate the character you created (male or female) in a top-down city. Avoiding getting hit by the numerous cars in the area, you must make your way to competition halls and participate in quiz shows. More areas will be unlocked as you win the tournaments. This time, giving the correct answer is more than just quickly choosing a word. Giving an answer is presented each time with a mini-game.

They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down.

After reading some lost scriptures, he determines that the only way to see them is to travel to the very top of the 64-story Tower of Babel. Upon reaching the Tower, he discovers that the only way to access the floors above him are to solve some challenging puzzles involving loose L-shaped blocks that he finds throughout the Tower. To his great surprise, the blocks are capable of balancing very well on top of one another, in order to form staircases. \n \nThe player controls Indiana Borgnine through 64 levels, using L-shaped blocks and vines in order to reach the exit of each level. On some levels, the exit is blocked by a mask, and there are crystal balls throughout the level. If all of the crystal balls on a level are collected, then the mask covering that level's exit will disappear, and the exit will no longer be blocked. When the exit of a level is reached, a screen is displayed showing the score achieved on that level before the character moves on to the next level. In the top right corner of the screen there is a power count. Lifting an L-shaped block causes the power count to go down by 1. Items will occasionally spawn while the player goes through the tower.es.",

Faced with extinction at the hands of a temporal paradox, Marty must find a way to reunite his future parents and make it back to his own time.\n\nLJN's game differs completely from the computer versions, and plays as a literal race against time broken up by brief arcade minigames. In the main game, the player controls Marty in an overhead view as he runs down the streets of 1950s Hill Valley.  A collection of period-appropriate bad guys block his path, including bullies, hula hoop girls, bumblebees, and park benches.  The camera scrolls forward at a fixed speed, so the player must keep Marty on the move and away from obstacles. Hitting one causes Marty to fall and lose a life. The player must also collect clocks scattered on the street to stop Marty's photograph from fading away.  If it fades completely, Marty is erased from existence.\n\nStreet running sections lead to three minigames. In these, Marty must sling milkshakes at oncoming bullies, deflect kisses (shown as hearts) from his mother, and collect notes to rock out on stage at the high school dance. The final stage resembles the street sections, as the player must control the DeLorean time machine and collect enough energy to travel through time (shown as lightning bolts instead of clocks).",

The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.\n\nThe Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. \n\nThe player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.\n\nScoring\n\nClose-in goals - 1 point\nGoals near Goldbeams - 2 points\nOTH shots - 3 points\nPlayers may steal points from each other by making goals. \nThe total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.\nA player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.",

A special set of Barcode Battler cards with barcodes imprinted on them were also required to play the game including the \"White Card\" that enabled players to scan any barcode (especially ones found on consumer products). \n \nBarcode World includes barcode cards that feature characters from many Sunsoft series, most notably Hebereke and Gimmick!, however using the White Card included with the game, players were also given the ability to scan a wide range of consumer products. Released during a period of great interest in barcode-swiping games in Japan, the game dates itself as directly from the early 1990s, however the game still functions today exactly as it did then and modern products may also be scanned in order to generate new content for the game (RPG-style stats and attributes, etc.).",

Most enemies can be defeated with attacks, but others must be avoided by jumping or running underneath them. \n \nThe game has a reputation as a \"kusoge\" (endearing term for a crappy game), explicable given its background as a quickie license cash-in.

After the events of the film Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, they seem free to build the band that will one day unite Earth's people and bring about world peace.  Except...  Rufus returns from the future with a warning that someone has warped the time continuum by kidnapping historical figures and stranding them in the wrong time period (...sooo, basically what Bill and Ted did in the first film?)  It's up to the boys to sort out the mess.\n\nThe player controls either Bill or Ted, who have split up to tackle the quest (allowing each to leave items to assist the other). Each \"mission\" begins by consulting a phone book of historical figures, and spotting the page whose number has changed (a second number, flashing in red).  The player dials that number, and guides the phone booth through the circuits of time. Rufus could only lend a payphone, so players will need to plot out the shortest path to their destination, while avoiding any hazards. Each change in direction costs one coin.\n\nOnce in the target time period, the player controls Bill or Ted through an isometric view as they search for the displaced historical figure.  The player must stick to a defined path to avoid falling, and must be cautious of the locals.  Some will offer clues or helpful items, while others demand a coin if bumped into.  Other locals will actively chase Bill and Ted and throw them in jail, where they must use a skeleton key (if they have one) to escape. Players can find and collect coins for the phone booth, keys for the jail, and distractions (like pudding or tape players) to throw off any pursuers.\n\nThe player must also locate an item of \"historical bait,\" appropriate to the target, to get them to follow. Once the historical dude has been baited and bagged, the player switches to the other member of the titular duo to rescue a new historical celebrity. The process repeats until time is corrected.",

The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.\n\nAdditionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different \"worlds\" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.",

During his travels, Jim will explore villages, fight his way on board ships, venture through caves, and wander around tropical islands.

When Jim touches, or is shot at, by a creature, he loses one of his lives, but when he kills a creature, he can collect some gold that they leave behind, which can be used to buy items from shops. However, rather than getting gold, enemies leave behind some gold containing one of the letters that spell the word \"CAPTAIN SILVER\". If Jim manages to get all of these letters, he will be awarded an extra life.\n\nJim may only use his sword to start off with, but once he collects a fairy that floats toward him in every scene, Jim will be able to shoot stars at enemies, making his kills more efficient. The maximum number of stars that he can have is six. There are other power-ups that Jim can collect in the game. These include the \"clock\" power-up, which gives Jim extra time; the \"boot\" power-up which allows Jim to jump higher; and the \"coffee?\" power-up, which enables Jim to shield himself from creatures until he is hit by one.\n\nThere is a boss in each scene, which he must defeat in order to proceed to the next round. There is also a certain time limit, which Jim must complete the scene before it expires. If he does not, then he will lose a life.",

Citizens who had banished the Belmont family now beg for Trevor Belmont's help in slaying Dracula. In his strange castle, Dracula has been assembling a massive army of undead creatures to sweep the Earth clean of life and bring everlasting darkness. Trevor agrees to help and equips his family's hereditary whip, the \"Vampire Slayer\", in order to destroy Dracula. \n \nCastlevania III: Dracula's Curse is a side-scrolling platform game. The gameplay is nearly identical to the first Castlevania game. The player takes the role of Trevor Belmont who is able to move left and right, jump, attack with his whip straight ahead and use a special weapon. These special weapons consume hearts, which can be found by defeating monsters or destroying candles. Power-ups include: a throwing dagger, a throwing axe, A time-stopping stopwatch, a cross-shaped boomerang and a vial of holy water. Additionally there is a double shot (II) and triple shot (III) power-up which increases the number of special weapons that can be used at one time. Trevor is defeated if his life meter runs out, and can find a roast turkey power-up to replenish it. Trevor progresses through each level defeating monsters and eventually encountering a boss creature. At different points in the game the player will be able to chose between different paths, which will determine which levels are played. \n \nAt the end of certain levels, the player may encounter a companion which can be recruited. Only one companion can accompany Trevor at any time; accepting a new companion means rejecting the existing one. Once recruited, Trevor can change between his own form and that of the companion. Each companion has an independent life meter and has unique abilities such as powerful magic, the ability to climb walls or flight. These abilities may also affect the types of power-ups that appear in candles and the exact function of special weapons.",

The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. \n\nThere are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:\n\n1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship.

The gameplay and general concept is simple with the inclusion of special cards you can receive to affect the others or yourself. In addition to gaining Yen, you can also gain Happiness Points, which you gain by buying souvenirs and sending them home to enjoy.",

His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. \n\nMuttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.",

The Exes are nearing completion of their secret weapon, Exed Exes, and they must be defeated before this is allowed to happen!\n\nExed Exes is a basic vertical scrolling shooter, converted from the 1985 coin-op. The game scrolls forward, and the player can maneuver their ship around the screen to shoot enemies and avoid attack. POW icons sometimes appear that can power up the ship or turn enemies into fruit that are worth extra points. The game can be played either solo or two-player cooperatively.",

        "name": "Cobra Triangle (USA)",
        "desc": "Cobra Triangle is a single-player boat-racing game that lets you do more than race. It borrows the power-up system from the shoot 'em up genre but keeps the emphasis more on maneuvering than shooting. Since you have a health meter with a dozen bars in it, it's not that important to dodge bullets unless your health is really low, but you should try not to run into too many walls. In order to get very far you need to make use of your power-ups which are TURBO for better acceleration; FIRE for increased firepower; SPEED for increased top-speed; MISSILE for firing missiles as well as bullets; and FORCE which makes you fire tons of missiles and also makes you invincible for a limited time. You get roughly one minute to complete each level. Speaking of which, there are 7 types of levels each with a different objective:\n\n(1) Race to the Finish - Shoot other boats along the way to the finish line and avoid enemies like turrets and sharks. Some boats tow power-up pods behind them that you can collect after you shoot them. It doesn't matter when you finish, and you aren't told if you get 1st or 2nd or 3rd place... it seems that the other boats are only there to get in your way. Watch for the fork in the river; choosing alternate paths takes you to the same levels of the game but in a different order.\n\n(2) Collect the Pods - Simply race in a straight path while running over ramps to collect pods and 1UP's in the air. You go on to the next level when time runs out.\n\n(3) Dispose of Mines - There is a small square in the water with mines in it. You actually have to collect the mines and tow them to another square to make them explode. Of course, there is an invincible enemy boat that tries to steal them back from you and some guys that shoot at you. It takes awhile since you can only tow them one at a time.\n\n(4) Fry the Monster - The 'boss' levels. You fight a sea-serpent, a crab, a shark, etc. He has his own health display right above yours, but it tends to deplete slower.\n(BONUS) Shoot the Targets - after every boss level you go to an auto-scrolling level where you are rewarded with a 1UP prize if you manage to shoot all the targets along the shore without missing any.\n\n(5) Guard the People - There's a large square filled with 8 helpless swimmers, and for some reason they're all about to be kidnapped. Other boats race into the square and tow them away unless you destroy their ships before they get away. You can tow the people back into the square-if you have time-while avoiding the spaceships that fire stunning missiles at you. If you have at least one swimmer left when the timer runs out then you pass.\n\n(6) Reach the Finish - Race in a straight course with plenty of obstacles but no other boats. You drive upstream while the current drags a horde of logs and whirlpools in your direction to stop you. Occasionally some planes fly by and shoot at you. If you happen to die in this or any other level, you simply reappear on the spot as long as you have an extra life. A continue puts you back at the beginning of the level you were on.\n\n(7) Jump the Waterfall - A level that consists of a series of moving ramps you must use to jump over huge pits. Moving currents, whirlpools, and the violation of several laws of physics makes this more difficult than it sounds.\n\nThe entire game consists of repeating these types of levels for a grand total of 25 stages. The later stages are much more difficult than the first. They're filled with additional obstacles like icebergs, more mines, more enemies, and longer courses. There are even speed-ramps that let you take small short-cuts in later racing levels.",

You start at the age of 14, becoming a apprentice aboard an old ship, where you learn the basics of combat. Your ultimate goal in this role-playing-game is to discover the continent America, just like the original model Christoph Kolumbus. \nThe Game can be played in two different modes. Either in \"Normal Mode\" or in \"Historical Mode\". The only difference of the historical mode compared to the normal mode, is that you have a limited ammount of time to complete the game. You start in December of 1465 and the game then ends by the end of 1492. The time ticks off, based on the number of steps you take, what means that you'll want to keep your steps as low as possible. \nDiscover the new world and take your place in history!",

In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the \"auto\" mode which delegates command to the AI.\nSplash graphics and text messages convey battle results.\n\nBy capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains \"fame\" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.\n\nWinning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.",

After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive.\n\nControl passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives",

This game retains the player-adjustable level-up stats from the first game, as well as the feature that removes randomized encounters if the player is at a significantly higher experience level than needed for their current location. One exclusive and rather annoying feature of this game engine is that sometimes the player character will fumble (remove) their equipped weapon, wasting that character's turn. If the player wishes to re-arm their weapon, it will cost the player another turn. This is the only game in the series to award the player money (Gold) when defeating enemies.

After all six missing parts of the sword are found, you can attempt the final level to defeat the Dark Fiend. In addition to the sword pieces, there are other items which can be found during the levels to help out; these include keys to open mystic doors, spheres to restore life, and different types of weapons.",

The main terrorist, Hans, is after the money locked away in a safe on the 30th floor. His hacker, Theo, is slowly breaking the locks into the vault. It's up to McClain to stop them. Die Hard for the Nintendo Entertainment System is a lot different to its other counterparts. The game is played from a top-down perspective, rather than the 1st-/3rd-person perspective.\n\nThere are 40 terrorists scattered throughout the building, and the task is to clear each floor of terrorists. The stairwell, air duct or the express elevator is used to travel only to Floors 31-35. These are freely accessible at any time, doing away with linearity, and more floors are unlocked in \"Advanced\" mode). At the start of the game, John can only use his fists to deal with foes, but after bringing down some terrorists, several weapons become available, including the pistol, machine gun, C-4 explosives, rocket launcher, and flash bangs, using their weapons against them. When hit by these terrorists, John loses some life, but it can be restored by collecting soda cans and med-kits. The game ends when all life is lost. \n\nOne interesting aspect of the game allows the player to listen to Hans shouting orders to his guards through a two-way radio. Also notable is the \"foot meter\". It starts out full, but will eventually decrease if John steps on shattered glass or runs around at a faster speed. If the meter is empty, he will walk much slower than with a full meter. This may have been added in tune with the film, where the main character John McClain's feet end up in pretty bad shape near the end. Parts of the environments are destructible, most notably vending machines (receive free soda), glass walls and windows. Not all parts of the environment are shown on the screen all the time - a fog of war appears to shroud nearby areas in darkness.\n\nThe missions are time limited. There about four minutes before one of the six locks are opened (shown in the status screen), but more time can be gained by destroying the main computer on the fourth level. Once all the locks have been opened, there are only a few minutes to escape. Once this time expires, the game ends.\n\nLike its counterparts, the game features cinematic sequences, which change the story depending on which actions are taken.",

To make matters worse, the mansion itself isn't looking too good. Strange \"holes\" into other dimensions have opened up and made a mess of the architecture. Furthermore, Dr.Chaos himself is missing.\n\nThe game takes place as a platform game where you must use various weapons (knife, pistol, machine pistol or grenade) to fight your way past mutants and into various rooms of the mansion. Once in these rooms, the view changes to a first person maze...  and you'll need to open various cabinets, doors and hit walls in special places to find access into a dimensional hole. Once you enter the dimensional hole, the game once again becomes a platform game, where you will need to fight your way to the end of the level and defeat a boss monster of some sort to obtain a piece of the Warpgate. Then you'll have to proceed BACK through the level and return to the mansion, where you'll explore to find the next dimensional hole. ",

He can also charge his sword to fire a magical projectile. The real power-up, however, is that he can transform into a flying dragon. When this happens, the game turns into a shmup-style game in which the scrolling moves at a constant rate and the dragon can shoot fireballs in a spread formation. Transforming into a dragon is restricted by a power meter.\n\nThe game features six levels of action-- a snow level, a cave level, a water level, an industrial level, and a haunted castle level. The sixth and final level is fought entirely as a dragon with unlimited flight capability.",

Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise. The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version) and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).",

The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. \n\nYou begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.\n\nThe game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.",

The game features a day/night cycle - as you travel, day slowly changes to night and vice versa; shops are typically closed at night. \n\nYou begin with control of just the main character but can quickly recruit three more members to your party. During the game you can choose to drop your current characters and recruit others at any time. The recruitable characters are divided into six classes: soldier, fighter, merchant, goof-off, pilgrim and wizard.\n\nThe game has a unique job system, giving you the ability to switch your hired characters' classes after they have achieved at least level 20 in their base class. Characters can switch to the other beginning classes, as well as the sage class, which is not available at the beginning. When a character switches classes, they lose all earned experience points, and half of their stats, but retain all of the abilities of the previous class. In this way, you can create powerful combination characters that are able to cast spells and fight effectively.",

To complete a stage, all he has to do is to get to the end of it alive.\n\nAt the end of some stages, Dirk will take an elevator that will lead him to other stages. The elevator makes short stops at some platforms, and you have to decide if Dirk will jump onto that platform or another. If  he takes the wrong platform, he may go back to a previous stage and go through it all over again. From the elevator Dirk can also get to a bonus level, the Lizard King's throne room, where he can try to recover the gold the King has stolen from him.\n\nAlthough Dirk has a life bar, he will instantly die if takes damage from the most of the threats. He also has a \"candle bar\", which is used (by pressing the start button) to light up dark places and to discover hidden items at specific locations.\n\nThe game can be played by 2 players taking turns.

In One Player mode, you face the computer in a five-game elimination tournament. Win them all, and you earn the right to challenge the awesome Amazons - All-Star Softball's all-time championship team. Of course, you and a friend can play each other in a head-to-head contest.\n\nThere are no preset ball clubs so you recruit 10-member squad from a roster of 60 weird players. Look for players who have strong basic baseball skills such as arm strength and speed. But to win on some of the tricky fields you'll also need players with more unusual skills - such as climbing fences, diving into water, and flying at night\n\nIn fast pitch, you hurl that baby in three speeds. But stay alert, base runners steal and batters bunt. In slow pitch, you can lob the ball short or long. You can also make your pitches curve right or left.Fielding the ball takes practice, but your guys can also dive for hard grounders and leap up to snare line shots. For quick double plays, infielders can tag a base then throw the ball.\n\nWith six softball fields to choose from, including the Sandlot, the Cliff, and a Professional field, there's some great action. Get ready to take yourself out to the softball park.",

Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.\n\nEnemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:\n\n1. Shooting them with his gun.\n2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.\n3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.\n4. Crushing them with an elevator.\n\nWhenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.\n\nWhile Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. \n\nJust because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.\n\nOtto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.\n\nIf Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.",

The races take place in such settings as open water, the bayou, and even industrial water districts. Each boat race consists of several sections. First, there is the starting line -- where you can expect a $2000 fine for a false start -- which begins with a brief side-scrolling race with split-screen background scrolling, a common characteristic of later NES titles. The primary sections of the races are a mixture of top-down racing and 3rd-person racing from a perspective behind the boats. The top-down sections are the most involved with numerous threats to avoid such as alligators, sharks, and whirlpools that will turn you the wrong way. There are also ramps to jump off of, people in need of rescue, nitro speed boost powerups, and raw cash bonuses to collect. The 3rd person segments have less detail and distraction but move much quicker as the 2 players vie to stay within the flags, collect speed boosts, and hit the occasional ramp. Speed boosts are collected along the way and can be used at the player's discretion to gain a much-needed edge at any point during the race.\n\nA race finishes back in the side-scrolling view. If the boats come through too close together, the bikini models on the sidelines act confused and request a slo-mo replay, which the game subsequently provides. Prize money is then awarded with which the players may use to repair and upgrade their boats with faster engines, tougher hulls, and better steering.",

However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment. \n \n\"Elysion\" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.",

The sensors inside would register the hits and transfer the information to the game, where the results of the player's punches would be shown on the screen.",

Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.\n4. Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.\n\nAs you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it.

The fourth of Namco's lengthy \"Family\" series of sports games and the first to concentrate on tennis, Family Tennis plays much like its Nintendo forebear and other tennis game contemporaries. It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win. \n \nFamily Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is \"Cosmos Mode\", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however. There was also four female characters, of the sixteen total, who all had a bigger racket then the men. Essentially making the women into an 'Easy Mode'",

To succeed the player must press the pads with there feet and hands at the same time as the on screen aerobics instructor. Any missed movements are recorded on a mistake counter and 10 missed movements will fail the level. The routines (a set of repeated movements) start slow and simple with a bit of no-penalty practise time however as the player gets better the routines get more complex with less practices time. Each level has a set number of routines that increase with each level from 4 at the start to a total of 32 on the final level (level 7). At the successful completion of each level the player will get a pass stamp which they can enter later to skip that level.\n\nThe second mode is mini-games called Pad Antics that includes Tune Up, Mat Melodies, and Ditto. Tune Up is where the 10 of the 12 pads (the centre 2 been where the player stands) makes a musical note (do, re, me etc.). Mat Melodies is like Tune Up but the player is given a song to play and the player must memorise to play the notes as they come as every missed note loses points, get over 80 points (from starting at 100) and progress to a harder song.  Ditto is like a one-player twister like game where the objective is to place you hands and feet where indicated on the mat on the screen with 1 or 2 points scored with every successful position.\n\nThe third mode is Aerobics Studios.  Aerobics Studios is the same as the main game but with only 4 levels (Studio 5,  Studio 10, Studio 15, and Studio 20) all unlocked at the start, a score that counts down from 100 with mistakes (or up if the player is doing well), no progression in levels, and the player can continue playing even if there score is at 0.",

You must destroy the large creatures in each world before moving on to the next. Your task becomes difficult by other small creatures that happen to pass by. If you destroy a large creature, they will drop a dollar bill, which you can pick up and use at the shop to buy items and powerful weapons such as laser beams, x-way shots, and big wings. Another way to get money is to shoot certain kinds of enemies all in a row.\n\nMore often than not, some large creatures will reveal a warp gate rather than a dollar bill. You can go through the warp gate to get to another part of the land, and destroy more large creatures. Only one of them will have a warp gate in the form of a 'stop' sign - that is your ticket to the round boss, but you must defeat all large creatures in order to pass through it. Also like in the original can you walk on the ground to avoid approaching enemies, and spend money in the shop to get new weapons (but they only last for a limited time).",

Only you can restore peace to the land by conquering the Evil One, who lives in the Evil Place.\n\nThere are many places you must visit during your quest including the medieval town, where you begin, country villages, fortresses, caves, and gloomy bogs - each with its own ambiance and musical score.  You will be talking with the villagers, collecting gold to buy weapons, armor and other objects, jumping over obstacles and using items.  Attack zombies, dwarves, giant snakes, wyverns, evil gnomes, or one-eyed one-footed things with a large collection of swords and daggers or zap them with a magic spell. \n\nAs areas are completed by defeating enemies, your character rises up in \u201clevels\u201d and achieves a new \u201crank\u201d which is tied directly to the restore password (called a \u201cmantra\u201d in the game). The higher your \u201crank\u201d, the more gold you start out with.  Saving a game can only be done in a shrine or temple with a priest.

After collecting a certain number of cat symbols, milk bottles or hearts will appear. Hearts improve Felix' current weapon. What types of weapon Felix can use, depends on what type of level he is in. There are lots of different weapons ranging from a boxing glove to motorcycles to tanks to spaceships. All weapons that are better than the standard weapon have an energy bar that diminishes over time and can be refilled by collecting milk bottles. Getting hit by an enemy decreases the level of Felix' current weapon. If he gets hit while carrying the standard weapon, he loses a life.\n\nThe Game Boy version plays virtually identically to the NES version, but features less levels.",

Final Fantasy is the game for the NES console that started it all.\n\nThe world is veiled in darkness. Winds don't blow, the seas are stormy, and the earth rots. All people can hope for is that the ancient prophecy will be finally fulfilled. \"When the world is veiled in darkness, four warriors will come...\" And indeed, they come - the four characters you have previously chosen. Their first quest is to free a princess from the evil Garland, and then the real journey begins...\n\nFinal Fantasy is played with an adventuring party rather than with a single character. Before the game starts, the player chooses four characters from six different classes: Fighter, Thief, Black Belt, White Mage, Red Mage, and Black Mage. Which four classes the player chooses for his characters is entirely up to him. He also gives the characters names. \n\nIn the game, the party walks around in a top-down world, visits cities, caves, palaces and other places to buy equipment, rest and get hints and new quests, and fights baddies when they are encountered. Final Fantasy uses a turn-based combat system; the ATB (active-time battle) system from the later installments is not used. In battle, the player gives each character in order a command (attack a particular enemy, cast a spell, use an item, or try to run.) Then the characters and the enemies act in a random order. Attacked enemies and party members lose hit points, dying when they reach zero HP. When all the enemies are defeated, living party members receive experience, eventually gaining a level and improving their stats when enough experience is accumulated. Slain party members can be revived in towns for a price. \n\nSpells are bought in cities in special shops. The spells are divided into two categories - white magic and black magic. White Mages can only use white magic, Black Mages can only use black magic, and Red Mages can use both. Casting spells in battle uses up magic points, which, like hit points, can be restored by resting in inns.",

You can control the blue units while the red ones are enemies. You have to attack enemies from various ranges, in function of the weapon you're using. Usually, you have to be one or two squares next to the enemy. When a battle is set, you see both characters; allies in blue on the right and the opponent in red on the left with a detailed animation. The enemy will counterattack if he can, and either you or the enemy may also do one more hit to close the battle. When you've finished, it's the computer's turn and it will do the same with its units. Once the HP (Health Points) of any unit reaches 0, they are definitely out of battle and can't return again, whether it's an enemy or an ally. ",

Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).",

Players control a Japanese fleet of heavy cruisers, battleships, submarines and aircraft carriers. \n \nA couple of things set this game apart from typical Famicom games. First, in addition to the cartridge and the manual, the game also came packaged with a large map and plastic models which represented ships and airplanes. The game never shows the entire state of the water, so it is up to the player to use the information that he or she has to update the representation of battle on the map using the plastic models. Second, no background music is heard while playing this game. Finally, this game makes use of a device known as the \"Turbo File,\" which was manufactured and sold by ASCII as well. This device was a hardware add-on for the Famicom which was used to save game progress. It was compatible with a number of other titles.",

Luckily Juan has entrusted the remaining scroll to his worthy student, Ryohi. Juan's last request was for Ryohi to visit Shorinji. Gengai, the bishop of Shorinji, took the young Ryohi under his wing.  Six years later, a letter of challenge is sent from the Tusk Soldiers, who are the enemies of Shorinji, The letter mentions the upcoming \"World Tournament of Contact Sports\". Ryuhi decides to take part in the tournament as a representative of Shorinji. Ryuhi also hears from  Gengai that it was the Tusk Soldiers who robbed Ryuhi's master of his scrolls and now Ryuhi plans on getting them back.\n\nThe player controls Ryuhi. During the side-scrolling portion of the game the player can use kung fu to dispose of enemies. There are also miniboss type enemies (the screen turns black when they appear)  that must be defeated because they drop items that must be collected in order to continue on. The items they drop go in a sequence of power-ups which will eventually allow you to get a key to exit the level. There are some one on one duels during fighting tournaments that involve hitting a target on an opponents body while defending the target on Ryuhi's body. ",

The object of each room is to throw tomatoes at the targets littered throughout the room before time expires. Sometimes these targets are numbered, so they have to be hit in numerical order. After all targets are hit, a key will appear allowing the player to move on to the next room. \n\nThis may appear simple, but the player's character is on rollerblades, thus making navigating not such a simple task. There are also blobs, boingers, the banana launcher, and the spray gun which will either try to hinder progress or take away time if the player gets hit by them. The player also has to deal with various terrain obstacles in each room such as slime covered ramps or icy floors.\n\nThe player starts with three lives, but can earn more by collecting 25 silver coins. There are also gold coins with each one equaling 5 silver coins.\n\nOther helpful items the player can collect are glop clocks, with the small ones adding 8 seconds, and the large ones adding 15 seconds to the game clock. There are also sneakers which will temporarily increase the player's speed. There are also starbursts, which increase the players score and warp cubes, which will send the player to another part of the Fun House.",

They are also prompted to choose team formation: 4-3-3, 4-2-4 or 4-4-2.\n\nThe game is played from a side-scrolling perspective.

Without the ball's possession, players can try to steal the ball (with button A) or skip to the next player (with button B). The goalkeeper control is manual, and players can make the goalkeeper jump (by pressing button A). Tied matches are decided on a penalty kick contest.\n\nPlayers can also watch single computer vs. computer matches.",

If the player does not complete a course in good time, the entire race track will disintegrate and leave the ship to fall down (and apparently splash into some water below).\n\nA notable item about this game is its use of squeaky, comical, digitized voices for exclamations when colliding with another player (\"Hey!\", \"Excuse me!\", \"Watch it!\"). There are also 2 completely different control schemes that a player can adopt for cruising around the course. The first scheme rotates and drives the ship in the direction that the control pad is being pressed. The second scheme uses left and right to rotate the ship and up to thrust in the direction the nose is pointing.",

The main character, Kitarou, is the last living member of a Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and y\u00c5 kai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter. While the game follows the release of Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou (released in the U.S as Ninja Kid), it is not a direct sequel to the original game, which is an action side-scroller.  \n \nGegege no Kitarou 2 plays very much like a simplified traditional RPG. Fights are turn-based, where the player must input his command, and then watch the sequence of event play out until the round is over and the next round begins. However, even though it is simplified, it is actually a rather difficult and challenging game. In the very beginning of the game, Kitarou struggles to survive more than two fights against monsters before needing to return home and rest until he reaches level 2. A majority of the enemies only provide experience points in the single digits until much later in the game, although to compensate, the amount of experience needed to reach each level is low by comparison as well. Kitarou maxes out at Level 10 when he reaches 999 experience points.  \n \nThe map of the game's overworld is a fairly faithful representation of Japan, along with part of Korea and a small unidentified island. Kitarou must explore the island nation to rescue his girlfriend and the rest of the world from the onslaught of evil Youkai that threaten to take over the world of the living. He must locate several homes, castles, and cave entrances to make his way through Japan, which suffers from spirit storms that prevent him from exploring new regions on the island until some task has been completed first.",

It does this through the use of nuclear accelerated \"proton packs\" and traps, whereby the ghosts can be captured and transferred to a secure storage facility. However New York City has suddenly become a very haunted place, and the number of ghosts has suddenly increased. The Ghostbusters must reduce the paranormal (PK) level in the city, representing ghost power, before the Temple of Zuul awakens and ressurects an evil goddess, Gozer.\n\nGhostbusters is an action game that combines an overhead view and a side-view. From Ghostbusters HQ, the player must monitor the map of New York City for \"ghost alarms\" as well as casual spirits, and plot a route to the alarmed area. The player then controls the Ghostbuster vehicle as it drives through traffic. Here, the player is able to capture casual ghosts on the way if they are en route. Once at the location, the game switches to a side-view. Two of the ghostbusters will take position and activate their proton beams and toss a trap to the ground. The player will attempt to  maneuver the ghost(s) over the placed trap. Once activated, the trap attempts to capture any ghosts directly above it. Successful capture will earn the player money, which can then be used to purchase new Ghostbusters vehicles and new modifications for the vehicle. Unsuccessful capture will see the ghost fly away.\n\nAs the game progresses, the PK energy of the city increases. Ghostbusters must keep it under critical levels by being constantly  successful at ghost captures. Eventually the Temple of Zuul will activate, and if the PK levels are still manageable, the Ghostbusters can venture there for a final showdown with Gozer.",

Dr. Femur wants to keep it for an overnight study, and Spike reluctantly agrees, noticing that the skull appeared bigger than the day before.\n\nDuring the night, the skull begins transmitting a message to the realm of the dead. On Halloween, the dead begin their assault. The teachers and students inside are turned into zombies and demons under the control of whatever intelligence has taken over the school. Samantha Pom-Pom, the head cheerleader, is captured by the dead and held somewhere inside the school. Paranormal eliminators and members of the football team have ventured inside to find her, but have not returned. When Spike learns of the mess from the TV news, he rushes to the school and decides to rescue her himself.\n\nSpike ventures inside. The doors shut and lock behind him. There's no turning back now.\n\nSpike begins his quest with only his trusty baseball bat and battered sneakers, but can collect better weapons and shoes along the way. Among them are the straightforward sickle, embalming fluid, towel and almighty gamma gun, the strange Deweytron and taserlike Spinal Zap, and a sandwich (if it can be used as a weapon, they should have fired the cafeteria workers a LONG time ago), among other weapons. Useful items include the spring shoes, needed to reach high places, the suction shoes, which allow you to walk on the ceiling, and the Golden Apple, needed to bypass the Medusa head guarding the way to the second half of the school.\n\nGet going! You have 129 rooms to explore and Samantha is counting on you. Good luck.",

The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.",

This is their second game on NES, The Goonies being released only for the Famicom system outside the United States.\n\nYou play Mikie, one of the gang members, whose friends have been kidnapped by the gang\u2019s arch enemy \u2013 the Fratelli family.  Your buddies and Annie the Mermaid must be rescued, but it won\u2019t be easy sneaking into the dark and creepy underground hideout where they are being held.  You must find a way to destroy their master computer and keep your friends from becoming road kill.  If Ma Fratelli or crazy Cousin Pipsqueak doesn\u2019t stop you, one of her two crazy sons will!\n\nUpon starting the game, Mikie is armed only with a yo-yo and the ability to jump.  As the game progresses, he will find boomerangs, a gun, bombs, molotave cocktails and even scuba gear to help him. Fight snakes, spiders, skeletons, man-eating fish while exploring the huge world full of cellars, secret caverns and elaborate mazes.\n\nThere is more than typical side-scrolling action, although there\u2019s certainly a multitude of that.  Seventeen magic implements and many secret messages await you.  When Mikie enters a room he can talk to NPCs and try to find hidden items and doors by hitting the walls.  A password lets you keep your possessions for the next game.",

        "desc": "Gotcha! is an NES Zapper title based on the \"sport\" of paintball, and loosely tied into the paintball-themed movie caper of the same name. You are required to traverse three different battle zones, grab the opposing teams' flag from the opposite end of the field, and make it back to your flag without getting shot.\n\nOne hand controls the Zapper while the other must hold the controller, since the D-Pad controls your movement up and down the field. Limited ammo is also a concern, as is the ability for the computer team to snag your flag and return it to their base to win. You can chase down and tag the flag carrier yourself to prevent this.\n\nThe game contains three difficulty levels and three different zones (woods, city, snowfield) which cycle until you lose all of your lives. Numbers of enemies and their reaction time increase with each cycle. Aside from additional ammo, there are no powerups, no teammates, just you against the computer for a beat-your-highest-score challenge.",

It features a basic leveling system that maxes out at 10 and basic HP and MP stats that increase by 10 each level up until they reach 99. The stages are also in the same vein as The Legend of Zelda in regards to the dungeons, albeit in a much simpler form. Instead of an overworld, you instead pick from five stages on a world map and each stage follows the same basic formula that consists of finding the key to open the door to the boss. Each stage contains various enemies that respawn, the occasional warp point, and a handful of chests that contain a new weapon, accessory and healing items. The final stage also follows the same pattern, but it's about five stages combined into one and borders on torture/redundancy with a series of mazes and long passageways that take forever to pass. It is at odds with the first five stages. \nThe game makes use of a branching path system that's based on the order in which you clear all the stages. If certain events are not triggered, you will get a bad ending. The optimal order is as follows:Castle, Ice Temple, Cave, Pyramid, Tower. If you enter the Tower before the Cave level, you will \nget the bad ending.If you enter the Pyramid before the Cave level, you will get an alternate story branch.",

Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.\n\nThroughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water.

Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\". \nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications. \nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.",

        "desc": "Hissatsu Shigotonin roughly translates to Deadly Work People. I found this name to be pretty strange, but once I started understanding what this game was all about, it made sense. It was released December 15, 1990 exclusively in Japan for the Famicom. It turns out Hissatsu Shigotonin is actually biased off of the popular Japanese historical drama TV series of the same name. The story of both focus on a group of ordinary \"work people\" who live double lives as assassins. It is an alternate Feudal Japan history (1603-1863) featuring fictional characters with elements of a parallel world. You must uncover a mystery though out the game, which comes though the story in episodes like the TV show. The player controls Nakamura Mondo, a fictional character who is also the star of the TV show. The game is biased on the original 84 episode run/first season of the TV series from 1979-1981 but features characters all the way up to the game\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s release date. The show continues to this day with Assassins as a subtitle. This seems like a really cool concept for a weekly episodic series. The story has an almost assassins creed feel. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m sure the idea of everyday people turned into warriors has been around in stories forever, but the setting and time period makes it stand out. Japan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s feudal era is one of the most intense of all the time periods in earth\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s history. It was a time of Samurai, Ninja and technology that eventually killed off said Samurai and Ninja. One of the biggest draws of the era is the is the fantastic culture that knew of the outside world, but worked hard in maintaining isolation making them truly unique. The main character, Nakamura Mondo, is a corrupt cop known for accepting bribes who is disrespected by his superiors, and mother-in-law. He ends up bringing together a group of people that have all been wronged in some way, formed to solve mysteries and assassinate targets. The heroes play by the same rules as the villains, as they are not afraid to use underhanded tactics to get the job done. Each episode of the show usually climaxes with the killing of the target, sometimes in an almost humorous manner such as a flower through the skull. I was able to find a random episode but no dubs or subs, which is a bummer since I wanted to learn more of the story. It seems to hold up well to time, has a campy feel to it and comes off like a live action anime. Check out this trailer for one of their many movies to get a better idea of the style, think Al Bundy the Samuri and his gang of misfits.",

        "desc": "Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku is the first real attempt to bring the Japanese board game Go to a home console, namely the Famicom. The game was designed by Henk Rogers, a Dutch programmer who would play games of Go against the CEO (at the time) of Nintendo, Hiroshi Yamauchi. It was during one such game that the prospect of developing such a title for the Famicom was discussed. It was later converted from disk format to cartridge and release in August 1987.  \n \nPrior to the release of this game, Nintendo had released a game which was played on the Go board in 1983, known as Gomoku Narabe Renju, but the play mechanics were more akin to \"Connect Four\" (or five, as it were). The real game of Go is traditionally played on a 19 \u00c3\u2014 19 grid, but the permutations of possibilities would take too long for the Famicom's processor to consider, so the board size has been significantly reduced to a 9 \u00c3\u2014 9 grid, which allows for a smoother single player experience. The game also features a lesson mode, in which ninjas appear to teach the player about the rules and strategy of the game.",

Once the style is chosen, the main keyboard is masked in the way that only the scale that easily fits into the style is available, e.g. blues scale, pentatonic scale, etc. \n \nThe keyboard is controlled by the UP-DOWN or LEFT-RIGHT d-pads on the game controller so there is no way to play leaps in the scale. \n \nDue to the hardware limitation, the sound produced is the typical 8-bit chiptune music.",

However, the only participants in the revolt are the player's character, Gonbe, and the optional second-player character, Tago (??), and the player battles against an army of ninjas instead of samurai and foot soldiers. The game displays text in the vertical direction, which was very unusual for a game of the period, and all in-game messages use speech reminiscent of jidaigeki films. \nThe game consists of four different levels, with the fifth level being an alternate version of the first, the sixth being an alternate version of the second, and so on. The difficulty gradually increases as the game progresses, and the game levels loop infinitely. There is no ending screen for the game, and completion of level 99 brings the player to level 00, which is an alternate version of the fourth level. The player returns to level 01 after completing level 00. A \"secret letter\" appears on-screen after each of the first 8 levels in the Famicom version. The secret letters displayed are E, R, A, W, T, F, O, S, in order, and if the letters are read backwards as indicated in the game's instruction manual, they form the word \"SOFTWARE.\" This code word was required for the gift campaign that was conducted during the game's initial release.",

For example, in the very beginning you receive a diary about the Grail from Indy's father, who is in Venice. At the same time, you receive a telegram from Marcus saying that the Cross of Coronado is in Portugal on a ship called Coronado, and that he'll meet Indy there. So you have to choose what you'll do first: go to Venice and check about the Grail and your father, or go to Portugal to find Marcus and the Cross of Coronado.\n\nIn the entire game you'll be prompted with these choices, each one leading to different stages throughout the game. Each stage presents different game genres. For example, in Venice you find a scrambled picture of the Grail, and you have to try to put it back together, just like you'd do with the pieces of a puzzle. Besides, in the platform stages, Indy has plenty of movements, as he can punch, kick, walk, run, jump and use his whip.\n\nThe game presents bitmapped pictures of the real movie actors, such as Harrison Ford and Sean Connery.",

A key element is the ability to invest in districts by purchasing stock, even if the player owns no property in that district, which increases the value of those properties and gives the player a cut of any transactions involving that district.

Along the way, the ship will stop to allow a diver to swim out and kill baby sharks, jellyfish and manta rays to find conch shells.  The conch shells are used to buy upgrades for the boat.  Extra conch shells can be earned in bonus rounds where a sea plane flies over the water to bomb jellyfish (think the bonus rounds of Galaga with reversed perspective).\n\nThe diver will battle Jaws several times in an attempt to wear down his life meter.  If the player is lucky, they can find a submarine to increase their firepower and defense.\n\nIf the diver manages to wear down Jaws' energy, they take back to the boat again, launching strobes into the water in an attempt to lure the shark out of the water.  If close enough, the player can use the boat to ram Jaws in an attempt to kill him and win the game.",

The sequel to Tobidase Daisakusen (known in North America as 3-D WorldRunner), JJ is a typical scrolling shooter, but it incorporates a third-person view, where the camera angle is positioned behind the main character. As in the previous title, the main character Jack must travel through various worlds, armed with his laser cannon and jumping ability, to defeat the serpentbeasts who have overrun the planets. JJ was the last game by Square to utilize the \"3D mode\" and 3D glasses, and was Square's last work before the inception of the popular Final Fantasy franchise. The soundtrack of JJ consists of eight tracks, and all of them are either remixed or reused from the game's prequel, 3-D WorldRunner.

Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name. \nThe plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack. \nA unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level. \nThe game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.",

In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.\n\nControlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called \"Action Mode\" and \"Shooting Mode\"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money (\"Balls\"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.\n\nOnce you have made your way to a \"Cyborg Rider\", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.\nAt the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level. \n",

In a local theme park called Leisure Island, children have been mysteriously disappearing and these disappearances are being attributed to a ruthless rival gang of ninjas. Equipped with his red mask and a mechanical hawk, it is up to the brave Hanamaru to journey throughout the park's fourteen areas and to rescue the captive children. The young ninja can run, jump or allow his hawk companion to attack enemies at long range. He can also collect special scrolls to increase his magic powers and cast various spells (press Down and B to activate them) - they range from lightning attack (kills all enemies on screen), ground shake (kills all enemies on the ground), Fire Hawk (unleashes the hawk super dive attack) and super jump (increases jumping speed for a short amount of time). Various special items are also available throughout the game, such as extra lives, invincibility and battle cards. Battle cards are a very important part of the gameplay - every now and then, Hanamaru encounters a boss that he must fight in a really unusual way (and apparently loosely based on the traditional Japanese disciplines of Ninjutsu). Boss battles are round based, and the player must pick a card with a higher face value than his opponent, and the difference represents how much damage the player (or the boss) takes. Thankfully, Hanamaru can collect special battle cards along the way - some can double or triple the face value of a card, whereas others prevent the boss from being able to attack for a round, or help Hanamaru regain some life. Although most of the game offers traditional side scrolling platformer action, several levels try out very different gameplay styles (Hanamaru can ride a Skateboard in some stages, or fly through the air with the help of his hawk companion).",

The story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.",

Cook. \n\nIf Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. \n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels. Apart from her own weapons, Tiki is able to squirt water at enemies if she gets to the top of the water.",

Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named \"Quick Passage Zone\") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks. ",

They are ruled by Shogun Tokugawa Lei Lei and his daughter, Tokugawa Usako. Unfortunately for them, the Prime Minister Kitsunezuka Ko'on No Kami is actively trying to depose both of them and wants to assume power by force! He's always got a plan up his sleeves, usually involving attacking the city using an army of Ninja Crows, led by Karamaru and Karasu Gennarisai (who also serves as Ko'on No Kami's advisor).\n\nIt's here where Inuyama Wanko-no-Kami, Chief of the Palace guard, steps in - by bringing in the Secret Ninja Team Nyankii! Whenever Wanko-No-Kami hears that Ko'on No Kami is plotting something, he dispatches the Nyankiis from their secret base at the Pizza Cat Restaurant so they can stop him before he is successful.\n\nHowever, there are rumors that a foreign scientist called Dr. Purple is aiding Ko'on No Kami... but for what purpose? What could Ko'on No Kami be planning this time?\n\nKyatto Ninden Teyandee is a side-scrolling action game in the tradition of Ninja Gaiden, and it is based off the Japanese TV show produced in 1990 by Tatsunoko Productions and Sotsu agency. There are eleven stages in total, and you can play as any of the three main Secret Ninja Team Nyankii members: Yattaro, leader of the team, who uses his Cat's Eye Sword as his main weapon; Pururun, the only female on the team, who attacks with projectiles and her razor-sharp nails; and Sukashii, who uses an umbrella to dispatch his enemies.\n\nBy pausing the game, you can switch out and change places with one of the four Rescue Team members in order to use their special abilities: Rikinoshin can break boulders, Mietoru can fly for a limited time, Gotton can drill through certain walls, and Nekkii can swim easily and use water attacks. You can only use their abilities for a limited amount of time, which can be recovered by picking up items with a cat paw printed on it.\n\nAll seven playable characters have an upgradable special move, which can be used by pressing Up + B. Each move is more devastating than the last, but can only be used a certain amount of times, until the Ninpo bar is drained.",

Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time. \nOddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games. \nThis game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.",

There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.\n\nThroughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.\n\nAll of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.",

        "desc": "In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.\n\nThe game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. \n\nLink's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. \n\nThere are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. \n\nTo find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. \n\nIf Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the \"2nd quest\", which is essentially a harder version of the game. \n\nThe Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.",

Your main weapon is used to attack flying enemies, and your secondary missile weapon is used to attack fixed placement, land-based enemies.  Numerous powerups are available along the way, and these both improve your weapons and your resistance to damage (every \"upgrade\" is worth a free hit from enemies without dying).\n\nSeveral secondary gameplay modes (Danger, Lucky, and Palace) are also triggered at key points in the vertical-scrolling mode.  All of the secondary modes are side-scrolling shooters.  The Danger stage requires you to face a gauntlet of enemies, while the Lucky stage is full of powerups, game continues, and other bonuses.  The Palace stage is triggered when you defeat a mini-boss; you must get past the palace defenses before you can face the end-of-stage boss.  And, oh yeah...don't get crushed by those walls!",

Having heard the news of the Emperor's capture they set out to defeat Blu Boltar and his Yoma Clan.\n\nLittle Ninja Brothers is the second game in the Super Chinese series and the first to be a role-playing game. Players, controlling either Jack or Ryu, explore the world map in an overhead view. Random encounters with monsters will give the option to flee or to fight. During combat, gameplay resembles the first Super Chinese game, where players move their character up, down, left and right... and can either punch or do a somersault jump to damage enemies. Additional power-ups, can also be found during the course of battles. Successfully defeating enemies awards experience points and Sen money. Jack and Ryu share experience points so they remain at the same level. A second player can join in at any time and share the experience level of the first player. Sen is the currency of the world and can be spent in the convenience store of each town to increase abilities and buy new weapons. Some of these include throwing stars, special martial arts techniques, swords, projectile attacks and other special powers. Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack & Ryu.\n\nWhen bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack & Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.\n\nLittle Ninja Brothers also features a field meeting mode where Jack and Ryu compete in a variety of sports themed events themed around a foot race. The different modes available for this competition include: a regular Dash, Popping Baloons, Athletic Obstacle Course, Finding a treasure hidden inside rocks, Eating food attached to balloons and finally, Shooting targets with projectiles.",

Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.\n\nThe first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.\n\n1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.\n\n2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.\n\n3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.\n\n4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.\n\nWhen all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.",

        "desc": "M.U.L.E. is about four hopeful explorers trying to make a fortune on a virgin planet. This is done by producing various goods (Food, Energy, Smithore, Crystite). Each of these goods have their uses: if you don't have enough food, you will have less time during your turn. If you don't have enough energy, your output will be lower. If enough smithore isn't produced, there will be a shortage of M.U.L.E.s. Crystite is the big earner that can make or break your game.\n\nYou start the game by selecting your race. Some are easier to play, some harder. There are three levels of difficulty, in the easiest the game only lasts 6 turns, but the real game is 12 turns. Crystite is not available at the easiest level.\n\nEach turn starts with land claim. Each player gets to choose a spot of land for themselves from the map. If two players choose the same spot, the player with less money wins. The map consists of different landscape. River is best for producing food, plains for energy, mountains for smithore. Crystite is hidden and must be first found by taking a land sample to the town.\n\nAfter the land claim each player takes turns in cultivating their land and do other tasks. They can buy M.U.L.E.s to start production on their land, sabotage other players by buying M.U.L.E.s and letting them loose, try to catch the Wumpus for cash and try to find crystite veins. The time to do these things depends on if the player has enough food. Finally the player goes to the casino and wins a small amount of money, depending on how much time was left.\n\nAfter the cultivation phase is the production phase where each land produces an amount of goods depending on a number of factors such as if the player has enough energy in storage, what type of land is used, and some random events such as sunspots that increase energy output. Also, if the same player has plots producing the same goods next to each other, they gain a bonus. Three plots of same production type anywhere on the map by the same player also gives a bonus.\n\nThird phase is the most interesting one: the auction. Here the players buy and sell their goods on open market. Players negotiate the price by moving up and down on the screen. The shop also has prices that depend on how abundant or scarce the goods is. So if there is a shortage of food, the price goes up and vice versa. This allows for interesting tactics, especially if one player manages to monopolize food, energy or smithore production. If there is no food, others don't have time to change their production types, if there is a shortage of energy, their land won't produce and if there are no M.U.L.E.s they can't change production type on their plot. Hoarding goods also has a drawback in the form of surplus where each turn a percentage of goods is wasted. \n\nThere are a number of random events in the game. Some affect one player, usually the one winning gets small penalties and the losing player(s) get small rewards. The big events that happen randomly are:\n- M.U.L.E. goes crazy - the M.U.L.E. on one of the plots runs away losing production for that round plus the money to replace it.\n- Planetquake - production of smithore and crystite is much lower.\n- Fire in store - all stock in the shops are destroyed (which means prices will skyrocket, but if you needed to buy something, you are at the mercy of other players).\n- Pirate attack - pirates steal all crystite from stores and players (in the easiest level they steal smithore). Nasty if you happened to have a lot of them waiting for better prices.\n- Acid rain storm - affects the plot under the storm and below it by boosting food production and decreasing energy production.\n- Sunspot activity - increases energy production.\n- Pest attack - eats all food on one plot.\n- Meteor strike - destroys the M.U.L.E on the plot it strikes but creates a very rich crystite plot.\n\nM.U.L.E always has four players, with 1-4 human players possible and the rest played by the AI. Because the players only need two buttons at most (up/down in auction) in auction, it's easy to play with four people around the computer. \n\nM.U.L.E is a very finely tuned game where rewards, penalties, time to use for various tasks etc. have been perfectly fine tuned to keep the game balanced. Rules and the random events mean that no two games are the same.",

        "desc": "Magic Carpet 1001 (called \"Arabian Nights\" in Chinese) is an unlicensed shoot-'em-up developed by Mega Soft (NTDEC) and distributed by NTDEC in 1991, Caltron and Gluk Video in 1992 and Asder in 1993 as part of the Asder 20-in-1 multicart. Its Caltron 6-in-1 incarnation is arguably the most well-known. \nThe game is a standard NES shoot-'em-up. It is four levels long and mostly takes place in an Arabian setting, with the fourth level being in space. There are many enemies that stand in the way of your character (an Aladdin-type who rides a magic carpet, although the title screen suggests he is a genie) which follow set patterns that become more complex with each level. \nAs well as this, all four levels have a different boss; a witch, a snake in a flying jar, a giant skull and giant lips respectively, with the latter often being considered to be far too difficult. Numerous power-ups can be collected at random by wiping out a certain group of enemies before they disappear, with P power-ups upgrading your weapon, S power-ups increasing the player's speed, an icon of your character's face for an extra life and hearts giving you several hit points, and a magic lamp in the fourth level which maxes out your character's health. By default, your character starts with 6 lives, dies in one hit and he can only fire one shot on the screen at a time. \nOddly for a shooter, this game does not have a score system whatsoever and the levels progress with the only warning being that the screen fades out after the boss. The ending is a picture of your character and (presumably) the damsel in distress you were rescuing, followed by a credits screen which has some of the names that appear in other Mega Soft games. \nThis game was later hacked in 1995 to produce Aladdin III, which is identical apart from the title screen which removes the company name and logo, as well as decreasing protagonist's minimal speed. This one appears on several multicarts. It is also unrelated to the Hummer Team pirate.",

Through their collection, Mag Max's strength increases.\n\nMag Max is a side-scrolling shooter game. At the beginning, Mag Max is only a tiny little fighter craft that can fire low-powered projectiles. As component pieces are found; such as a head, legs and a laser lance, Mag Max's offensive power increases. Access to the underworld can be granted through small dark craters on the landscape. Once in the underworld, Mag Max's weapons vary slightly as do the enemies (there are no stationary objects underground). Enemy fire or contact on each of the components will destroy that component. Fire on the main fighter will destroy Mag Max. At the end of each level awaits a boss creature. ",

Hacker International's version, Shisen Mahjong - Seifuku Hen, has added erotic themes. In the game the player(s) tackle six difficulty levels with three levels in each that reveal their own set of erotic images upon completion of each stage. The game's notable in that it features voice clips (although low quality) and is very difficult, partially due to the lackluster programming. There's a two-player mode in the game where if a connection isn't made in time, a sound clip will play and the other player will take control.

It is a sequel to a 1984 arcade game developed by Capcom known as Pirate Ship Higemaru. Neither the arcade game, nor this adventure adaptation were released outside Japan, although a prototype exists for a canceled North American NES release, where it was to be renamed \"Makai Island\". \nIn Higemaru Makaijima, the hero from Pirate Ship Higemaru named Momotaru must now pilot his own sailing vessel around the ocean surrounding seven islands. His goal is to find the greatest treasure. To do this, he must collect the keys which open the dock gates to each of the islands by invading several pirate ships and defeating the captain on board in combat. The gameplay on these pirate ships are taken directly from the arcade predecessor, with some small modifications. \nOnce Momotaru has collected a key from a pirate ship, he must then sail around the islands in search of the correct dock gate which the key corresponds to. Once there, the player embarks on an exploration of the island to find items, defeat a boss, and collect treasures before heading off in search of another island key. The island exploration sections are extremely reminiscent of dungeon exploration aspects of The Legend of Zelda, to which the game is often compared to.",

Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.\n\nThe game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.\n\nAfter each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.\n\nAfter the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.\n\nThe two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.",

Dr. Wily has escaped from prison and is madder than ever, this time creating eight new Robot Masters of his own to take over the world and crush Mega Man!  Is the world doomed?\n\nMega Man 2 is the sequel to the NES game Mega Man. In this game, Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man and Wood Man are Dr. Wily's eight prize creations that have been sent to take over the world.  As Mega Man defeats these bosses, he can steal their powers and use them for himself.  Each Robot Master is weak against another's weapon, and through experimentation, Mega Man can gain the upper hand by using the weapon they're vulnerable against.\n\nOther additions to the game include the 'E-Tank' - an item that can be used at any time to completely refill Mega Man's energy, and a Password System, which allows players to continue their game by recording which Robot Masters have been defeated and how many E-Tanks they have.  Mega Man 2 also removes the scoring system from the original game.",

If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica. \nThe original version was released by C&E themselves under the title Magic Bubble in 1991. It was licensed to American Video Entertainment, who released it in the same year under the title Mermaids of Atlantis, with all pornographic elements removed or obscured. A localized version leaving all pornographic content intact was released by Hacker International in Japan as Soap Panic and by Panesian in the United States as Bubble Bath Babes. \nThe game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.",

Although the game was not licensed by Nintendo, it is designed for play on the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is one of three pornographic themed games released by Panesian, along with Hot Slots and Peek A Boo Poker \nThe gameplay is reminiscent of that of Tetris and Puzzle Bobble in that the goal is to steer clusters of rising bubbles and place them so that they connect to other bubbles of similar color along the top of the screen. If the sufficient number of similar bubbles are touching, they will be cleared and all free neighboring bubbles will rise further, allowing for combos. If the accumulated bubbles on screen reach the bottom of the playing area, the game is over. If a level is completed, the player will be rewarded with erotica. \nThe original version was released by C&E themselves under the title Magic Bubble in 1991. It was licensed to American Video Entertainment, who released it in the same year under the title Mermaids of Atlantis, with all pornographic elements removed or obscured. A localized version leaving all pornographic content intact was released by Hacker International in Japan as Soap Panic and by Panesian in the United States as Bubble Bath Babes. \nThe game is very difficult to find and is sought after by collectors, often topping prices of $1000 U.S. Dollars on auction sites such as eBay.",

In each area, his mission is to collect three diamonds that contain letters. Doing so will spell a word. Then, Mickey ventures to the end of the level and collects a large slab. If Mickey collects the three diamonds in the stage to spell a 3-letter word, Mickey spells the word with digitized audio samples and says the word, complete with an illustration. Then, the slab that Mickey collected at the end of the stage is fed by Goofy through a large machine that spits out a letter. It is up to the player to identify which letter this is.\n\nThis game is oriented towards very young children. As such, it is essentially impossible to fail. There are many enemies in the game but none actually inflict harm. Snakes, porcupines, hippos, alligators, and even baby seals-- Mickey just bounces off each. Mickey can also swim handily and sustain long falls.\n\nFurther, the game allows the player to point at letters on a board and have Mickey say them using the cartridge's library of digitized mouse voice samples.",

The characters have all been squished down to super-deformed 8-bit likenesses.  Graphically this looks similar to River City Ransom. Each character has a button for attack and a button for jumping. Pressing the two together unleashes a character-specific super-move. Various grabbing moves and throws can also be done by moving the player near an enemy.",

In the kingdom of Palmeccia both the King and Queen have been murdered by the hands of a servant of Ragon, son of the Zuhl. The player takes control of the Prince of Palmeccia in a quest for revenge and to kill the evil Ragon. \nFundamentally, the game plays and looks like Dragon Quest. The player is given control of a single character and can explore a number of towns, dungeons, and the world map itself. However, once the player receives the ship for sailing, the game becomes non-linear as the player can explore almost anywhere that can be reached. \nAnother unique feature is the battle system. Like a typical RPG, there are random battles, but actual combat resembles a sort of action RPG. In battle, the player starts at the bottom of the screen facing the enemies that are at the top. In order to defeat enemies, the player must run into one in order to exchange blows. The closest analog to this unusual system is the MMORPG, or the MMORPG-ish single player game Final Fantasy XII. \nBeyond that, the basic plot and some of the battle system concept seems to have been co-opted by Sega's Sword of Vermilion.",

When he grows up, he goes to the island of demons, fights them, takes their treasure, and restores peace in its village. In this game, you don't play directly the story of Momotarou, but control three other popular characters from Japanese folklore, playing three separate stories: as Yashahime, the daughter of the Hell King Emma; Binbougami, or \"poverty god\", who is hated by people because he takes money from them; and Urashima, the legendary fisherman who once saved a turtle and became friends with the dragon clan. Although the original stories have nothing or little to do with each other or the story of Momotarou, the game ties the stories together by featuring Momotarou as a character in every one of them.\n\nDespite being primarily a game for kids (the story is told in a fairy-tale fashion), this is a full-fledged console-style RPG with levels, party management, world map traveling, dungeons, towns, weapons and armors, and turn-based combat against randomly appearing enemies, viewed from first person perspective.

The game can be played against computer AI or  human opponents (up to three). It is a board game in which the players' trains are positioned on the map of Japan, divided into sections with circles that determine the amount of moves. The latter is decided by a roll of a dice.

Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.\n\nEighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.\n\nClosely related to the SNES game  EarthBound, \"Mother\" is an unusual console-style RPG set in modern times. Combat system is similar to Dragon Warrior: you meet random enemies and bosses, and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Instead of magic, your characters can use special psychic powers called PSI.",

The gameplay and design in the one-on-one fighting parts resemble Taito's other fighting game, Great Swordsman, especially its kendo mode. \nThe game's plot is about the son of two Kendo champions named Musashi. He strives to become as great at Kendo as his parents. The entire story centers around the world of Kendo and its up-and-coming competitors. The anime is broken up into two parts. The first part follows Musashi's early years in grade school while the second part follows his high school years. In the first episode, Musashi befriends an Akita puppy who is by his side throughout the series. \nThere are two different modes: single player and two player VS. mode. On single player mode, the player depicts Musashi in the middle of his training. He must run through several obstacle courses collecting swords and other items along the way. At the same time, his pet Akita will be running the course behind him. Musashi must not fall too far behind his dog. After completing three courses, Musashi will be entered into a 2D weapon-based versus fighting-style Kendo tournament. He must defeat five competitors to win the tournament. The swords that Musashi collects during the obstacle courses provide him with access to special strike moves if he has collected enough. If the player succeeds in winning, the game will continue from the beginning at a higher level of difficulty. After winning the championship a second time, the game is over. \nOn two player vs. mode, each player selects from a roster of competitors, and selects them secretly by pressing different inputs on the control pad. The selections are revealed once five selections have been made. Each player then squares off in a Kendo match with each of their selections. Whoever gets three or more victories wins the game.",

Four years later, the game (with several modifications) was released in North America under the title Puss 'n Boots: Pero's Great Adventure. \nPero has to either avoid or eliminate this cat-like enemies who stands in his way. The main character is the Puss in Boots character from the tale; a cat named Pero (Toei Animation's mascot) He is also known as 'Perrault' in the game, as that was the name of the original author of the Puss In Boots story; Charles Perrault. He is known for helping an impoverished master attain wealth through the use of trickery. \nLoosely based on Jules Verne's classic novel Around the World in Eighty Days tied together with a classic anime, the player has 80 days in order to travel the world; this is shown through a time limit. One day passes in the game approximately every minute, although certain items can subtract the number of remaining days, providing the player with less time to complete the game. If these 80 days elapse before the player finishes the trip, the game is over no matter how many lives the player has remaining. Places that are explored include: England, the Atlantic Ocean, Arabia, Hong Kong, the Pacific Ocean, Alaska, the North Pole, and Big Ben. The game features \"death water,\" a video game feature where video game characters instantly die after coming into contact with a watery substance. \nThis game also involves driving boats, cars, and balloons in addition to the standard walking through the stages.",

If your bullet counter reaches one, you can only fire one bullet at a time, so you need to find some more. Also, it is important not to waste all of your missiles: you might need them later when you deal with later enemies like Mr. Big. You are also backed up by a chopper and a mean shiny street machine.\n\nMore often than not, when you blow up enemies, you can pick up several items that they drop, including drugs, money, ammunition, missile launchers, and if you're lucky, safe cards.  Even if you got the safe card and can pass the level, you can keep blowing up enemies to score more points. According to the game, this game is for training purposes only, so you will not get employed by your local DEA office. Is this what the DEA does every day: go on rampages?",

The kicking and punting games are handled with a fairly typical directional arrow/power meter system.\n\nGames are divided into four 15-minute (accelerated real-time) quarters.  There are no penalties, but referees do appear onscreen to signal touchdowns/field goals, take measurements on short yardage plays, and shout \"First Down!\" (in audio) whenever a team moves the chains.

It had many features the previous games in the series did not, such as a power up to extend the length of your sword, a new vertical \"wave\" attack and vertically-scrolling levels. The US version of the game is reputed to be the hardest in the series, due to the extra damage incurred when hit, slightly shorter regular sword length, limited continues and more enemies.\n\nThe Lynx port is the second Ninja Gaiden game on the platform, the first being a port from the Arcade Version. This port is identical to the NES game, but the in-game picture is compressed for the smaller screen of the Lynx. ",

        "desc": "Ninja Hattori-kun (lit. \"Little Ninja Hattori\") is a 1986 video game software developed and published by Hudson Soft for the Nintendo Family Computer exclusively in Japan. It is based on Fujiko Fujio A's (the pen name of Motoo Abiko) Japanese manga series of the same name, which later became an anime series and Asian franchise. The game was released around the same time the anime was aired. It was the fifth best selling Famicom game released in 1986, selling approximately 1,500,000 copies in its lifetime. \nThe plot begins when a young ninja name Kanzo Hattori was in search of his master in order to complete his training. While searching for his master, he encountered a young 10-year-old boy name Ken (Ken'ichi) Mitsobahis and made him his temporary replacement master, in order to develop Ken's confidence, while they went on many adventures together. It was aimed at a young audience the same way as the manga and anime it is based on. \nIn the game, player controls Kanzo Hattori in a side-scrolling action game. Hattori must run to the right over various terrains, but primarily through the woods. In addition to using throwing stars, Hattori can access one of the other ninja techniques, like Kagebashin, Happou no Shuriken, etc. In fact, he learns a total of 11 ninpou; however, he must first collect scrolls that provide those abilities before he can use them. Due to sluggish controls, it can be difficult to clear some of the obstacles that he will face without the ninja abilities to enhance his mobility.",

Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! \"Lettuce check it out,\" urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. \"I yam King Kale,\" he says, \"Won't you peas peas help me?\" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before. \n \nIt seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and \"vegetable-themed\" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist. \n \nOur two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.",

        "desc": "In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. \n\nJajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.\n\nIn each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.\n\nAs the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a \"boss\". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.\n\nItems can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.\n\nThe items in this game are:\n\n1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.\n\n2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured!\n\n3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.\n\n4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.\n\n5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.\n2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare!\n\n6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.\n\n7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.",

        "desc": "Nobunaga's Ambition II is the sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.\n\nThe game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on. Functionally, the first job is to let prosper the fief (province) under the player's control through agricultural development and town investment. \n\nThere are two scenarios available in the game: \n\n1. Warlords: 1560 A.D.\nThe first scenario begins as the daimyo prepare what will eventually become a full scale war in the whole of Japan. The warring states period begins here. There are 28 of them included in the scenario, among others: the Mori clan, the Takeda, the Hojo clan, the Uesugi clan, etc.\n\nNobunaga's Ambition: 1582 A.D.\nThe second scenario follows the rise of Oda Nobunaga in 1582 A.D. to power and allows the player to play either as Oda Nobunaga or as one of his chief allies or rivals. \n\nSamurai\nThe game improves on its predecessor by including some 400 historical samurai in the game, providing the player with generals for troops and governors for a conquered fief. \n\nEach samurai is characterized by statistics: Age, Rank, Body Points, War, Politics, Ambition, Charisma, and Loyalty. There are also additional attributes for specific military purposes: Skill, Arms Level, and Unit Type. Some of these attributes may be improved through training (i.e. war, politics, and skill), rewards (i.e. loyalty), or through merchants (i.e. arms level). \n\nStrategy\nThe game is turn-based, with each turn representing one month. Certain events take place annually such as tax collecting (March) and rice harvest (September), while other events, such as invading neighbors, follows the player's time table.\n\nThe game uses an initiative system to determine what actions can be completed in a particular month. Each daimyo and samurai has a stock of \"Body Points\" that represent the attention he can afford to spend on an action. Each action has a cost in Body Points for the character executing it, and if he does not have the point\u2019s necessary, he may not perform it. Body Points are refreshed a little each month. The level of Body Points refreshed per month is depends on the level of his Political skill. Intensive operations will deplete Body Points and then require turns of inaction to stock up again, so timing actions to coincide with Body Point availability is an extra wrinkle to the management of resources.\n\nCombat\nEach samurai can lead a 100-strong unit, which must be recruited, then trained, and equipped with weapons for battle. The attack of an army results in a tactical play out of the resulting battle or siege. A hex-based map of the area of the battlefield will form the playing board for the movement to combat and actual fighting. Fortifications (castles) have a dramatic benefit for the defender. The attacker must defeat the defender within 30 days or must force a withdrawal. Additionally, both sides must pay attention to their food provisions as each day subtracts food supplies in accordance to their army size.\n\nUnit Types\nThe game introduces 3 basic military unit types: Infantry (Inf), Cavalry (Cav), and Rifles (Rif). Each unit type has certain special abilities and tactical advantages/disadvantages in combat:\n\n1. Infantry have the ability to ambush anywhere on the main fief map (explained later) and have 4 movement points; \nCavalry have the ability to charge at an enemy (inflicting considerable damage on both sides) with the chance of breaking through the defending unit and emerging on the other side. Samurai leaders may often be killed (instead of captured) if their unit reaches zero. Cavalry have 6 movement points; Rifles may attack using muskets which have devastating offensive capabilities, which may also kill an enemy samurai unit if the opponent's unit reaches zero (thus, a standard non-rifle attack is also available for capturing an enemy samurai leader). Rifles have 3 movement points.\n\n \nAdditionally, both Infantry and Rifle units may move over walls or through water during the castle siege for a certain amount of movement points.\n\nTactical Combat\nTactical combat occurs in two different locations:\n\nThe first is the tactical map of the fief, where the attackers first arrive and the defenders surrounding the castle. In this setting, each days is divided into three time periods: morning, afternoon, and night, before the day ends. At night, armies may maneuver to surprise attack enemies in the dark, which does considerably more damage than an average attack. This may be done if the enemy is at least two squares away (not adjacent).\n\nThe second is the castle siege map, which occurs if the defender chooses to retreat to the castle from the previous map. Here, each turn represents one day, thus the time limit of the attack as well as the provisions of both sides, rapidly decrease with each turn. In this setting, the siege force must break down gates leading towards the castle for the final engagement. The defender is defeated, if the governor of the fief retreats, or if his unit is destroyed: resulting either in his capture or death.\n\nThe end outcome is either the fall of the fief to the attacking forces or victory for the defenders. Either way, captured samurai (if any) will require a prompt response for release, beheading, or recruitment to the winner's force.",

Sewer snakes also come out to kill the player with its poisonous venom. Triangle cones can momentarily block progress for the player. The game was targeted to a much younger audience than was considered to be \"average\" in the Nintendo Entertainment System community during that era. Using the classical music song Ballet des poussins dans leurs coques (composed by Modest Mussorgsky) as the background music, there is a common theme throughout the game of \"dog catches cat; cat catches fish\" - emulating the food chain.",

The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.\n\nThey decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm!\n\nOutlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.",

However, during a scientific experiment in hyperdrive technology, Epsilon scientists discovered four \"buffer\" dimensions, each containing a number of barren planets that exist between the Epsilon Galaxy and another alien dimension. Unfortunately, the most powerful empires from these alternate dimensions have also just discovered these zones through their own experiments. The player must battle these alien species for control of these buffer worlds, to ensure that their rule in the Epsilon Galaxy remains intact.\n\nTo make the new planets useful in the player's campaign, they can purchase terraforming equipment which can transform them into tropical Gaian-esque worlds which are ideal for agriculture, mineral-rich and heavily volcanic worlds, desert planets capable of producing vast amounts of energy, or ecologically balanced planets that can support large cities which are readily able to generate significant income through taxation. In addition, the player can mine for resources and tax their citizens to raise money, construct spaceship-buildings to feed the populace, enlist soldiers and equip them, buy battle cruisers or other craft to move from planet to planet, and so on. The player can fight battles, colonize planets, and even spy on alien races. The end goal is to ensure that the other alien races do not gain the upper hand by conquering these four new dimensions before the player can.\n\nThe player cannot retreat from battle, as the only way to shut down the hyperspace link from their universe to Epsilon would be by vaporizing the player's homeworld, which is where the hyperspace generator is located. Politically (at the very least), this is not an option.\n\nBlood will have to be shed for supremacy of the hyperspace planets, and for the player to become Overlord of these four new dimensions plus their own.",

It's a bit like Tetris, and a bit like Klax.\n\nTwo modes are available: Mode 1 puts your player on top of a growing pile which must be eliminated. It can be played alone (single), against another human (match) or in a quest against the computer. \n\nMode 2 puts your player on an already well-stocked pile, but unlike mode 1, the stacks can't be rearranged in order to reach the desired dice, so you have to make do with what is in the top layer to match whatever dice is shown on top of the playfield. An opposing player does the same, and the first one to reach the bottom wins. If both players run out of matching dice, a countdown begins to reveal a new dice, and it's necessary to react quickly to find the matching one in your pile.

From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).\n\nThis game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.",

        "desc": "Based on the board game, the object is to guess either a word or phrase based on a drawing. Each team starts on the same square on the board and the first team attempts to draw a picture based on a clue.  If his team correctly guesses the clue, then this team gets to roll the dice and advance along the board.  If the team fails to guess correctly, then the other team gets a chance to draw and guess. The game plays much in this way until a team reaches the final square on the board and successfully guesses the clue to win the game.\n\nThis game contains three different modes; regular game, alternative game, and drawing practice. It also allows for up to four teams which can be made comprising of any number of players per each team. \n\nIn the regular game, a team will be given a turn to start revealing pieces of one of the 500+ drawings that are hidden in the game. Each drawing is a 6x8 size and has 48 pieces to it. To reveal the pieces, the player is made to play one of four timed minigames which are chosen depending on the color of the square the player landed on the board. The minigames consist of Attack of the Paint Zombies, The WareHouse Shuffle, Leapin' Energy Capsules!, and Four Alarm Rescue. In Attack of the Paint Zombies the player fires downwards at the aliens and the more aliens that are hit the more pieces that are revealed of the drawing. If the aliens hit the player, the player loses time off the clock. In The WareHouse Shuffle, the player goes all the way to the left side and then stacks as many boxes on top of each other that they can bring over all the way to the right side. While transporting the boxes, their are two enemies who can hit into your boxes thus subtracting them from the haul and also taking time away. Each box brought over reduces a piece of the hidden drawing. In  Leapin' Energy Capsules!, the player is an astronaut and is moving and jumping to collect blue spheres. While collecting the spheres the player must try to avoid hitting any enemies which will reduce time. Each sphere collected clears up another piece of the drawing. In Four Alarm Rescue, the player controls a pair of firemen on the ground with a net who are moving back and forth catching the jumping people above on the net. Each person rescued leads a revealed piece of the drawing while each person not rescued leads to reduced time.\n\nThe alternative game allows the player to draw the picture for other players to guess, so their are no minigames in this mode. Other than that, it is the same as the regular mode.\n\nDrawing practice lets the player practice their drawing technique without the pressure of a timer.",

Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.\n\nBefore the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.\n\nBonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of \"Connect 4\".",

If the wolves land safely on the ground, then they can climb a ladder, near the cable-car, and catch Mrs. Pig.

If she gets to the top, she can get meat, to toss at the wolves and make them jump off their balloons in pursuit.  Each wolf taken out this way is worth bonus points (on a doubling scheme: 400, 800 1600...)\n\nThe second scene takes place at the wolves lair.  Here the wolves have reinforced balloons--it takes multiple hits to make them fall.  Here they float upwards toward a big rock, which they push on top of Mrs. Pig, when seven wolves are present.  Additionally, an alpha wolf (wolf leader) appears and summons wolves in packs.",

This is historically relevant as it would become common practice for future sports game franchises worldwide. This game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. Although the original R.B.I.

As with modern-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Unlike the previous versions there are now four stadiums to choose from. In addition to the size of the stadium, the presence of wind and the turf available in the stadium affect elements of the game. The concept of 'strong players' was also introduced in this version. Two players in the starting line-up are chosen at random to have their stats increased higher than usual. During the seventh inning, the 'Lucky 7' effect occurs, and all players receive enhanced status. The team edit function appears for the first time in this game (edited teams would disappear when the console power was turned off since no battery backup was included). Though this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3.

Since he had lost the title to James \"Buster\" Douglas by that point, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new contract with him. Tyson was however, slated to appear in a sequel of his own (Power Punch II) where he would be the protagonist, but as a result of his imprisonment, Nintendo lost interest and instead used a generic boxer named Mark Tyler. \nDue to Mr. Dream being a simple head-swap and recolor of Mike Tyson, Mr. Dream fights in exactly the same manner as Mike Tyson in \"Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!\" but has a better fighting record. For the first 90 seconds of the first round, Mr. Dream can floor Mac with one uppercut. The player can block these punches to reduce the impact, but it isn't recommended, as they l end up with little health left after that.

Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)\n\nThe game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.",

C.J.'s Elephant Antics: C.J. the elephant went and got himself caught in an elephant trap. One thing led to another and the next thing you know, he's in a Parisian zoo. He makes a break for it and vows to make his way back home to Africa, traveling through Paris, Switzerland, and Egypt in order to reach his destination. This game is a side-scrolling action game. Offensively, C.J. can toss bombs at myriad enemies in his path. He also has a parachute that allows him to glide safely down from great heights. 2 players can play this game cooperatively as 2 differently colored C.J. characters.\n\n2. Stunt Buggies: this game involves 1 or 2 players piloting buggies around dangerous mazes filled with renegade buggies on a quest to collect all the bombs in order to escape the maze.\n\n3. F-16 Renegade: your crazy professor has hacked into the US Air Force's computers and programmed all of the jets to fly off and start World War III. Since no one will believe your tale on this matter, you take it upon yourself to follow your professor's footsteps: you hack into the USAF computers yourself but to locate the F-16 training program so that you can then break into the air base and heist a jet in order to take down all of the malevolent computer-controlled jets. The action in this game consists of flying a jet and shooting other jets. However, the perspective alternates from overhead scrolling (odd levels) to 3rd person view from behind the jet (even levels). Powerups come in the form of stronger weapons, smart bombs, and extra lives. The game also features a 2-player competitive mode.\n\n4. Go! Dizzy Go!: Dizzy's nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks, has abducted Dizzy's friends. Thus, the task falls to Dizzy to rescue them. To do this, he must collect fruit in a variety of dangerous mazes scattered throughout several worlds including an underwater realm, forest realm, a pyramid, a mountain, and a castle. Additionally, 2 players can team up to conquer the mazes.\n\nAll of the games feature 2-player modes. This is an unlicensed NES game.",

Also new is a turbo boost which allows you to reach speeds of 255 mph. Unlike the original game, you now only have a choice of one car and the red-blue 3D glasses aren't supported. ",

During the construction of Altile, humanity has become united and peaceful. During this new era of prosperity, Earth decommissions the RoboWarriors, a force of heavily armed half-man half-robot war vehicles. But from another dimension, aliens calling themselves the Xantho Empire and lead by the being Xur invade planet Altile and terraform it for their own uses. The survivors of Altile send out a distress call to Earth. Receiving this message, the people of Earth quickly activate the latest and most powerful of the RoboWarriors, a model known as ZED (Z-Type Earth Defense) and send it at top speed to Altile.\n\nControlling ZED from an overhead view, the player is able to move in any of 4 directions (up,down,left,right), drop bombs and shoot a projectile weapon. The terrain of Altile is made up of many obstacles and the bombs serve to destroy these and make passage for ZED. Destroying any enemy or obstacle may yield different power-ups which contain any of 10 different effects (including ammunition and energy refills) which may be stocked and used at any time from the menu. Or the power-ups may be instant-use refills for bombs and energy supplies.\n\nAdditionally some levels contain keys, which unlock doors and Chalices which prevent the level from running on endlessly. Secret areas such as a Well of Hope and a Room of Idols may also be found. Altogether, there are eight different \"worlds\" for ZED to conquer, containing numerous stages and guarded by a vicious boss monster.",

        "desc": "\"Calling Mega Man! Calling Mega Man! Come in please! ....\"\n\nThis is a traditional action-platformer: you jump from brick to brick while avoiding pits and shooting robots. It's quite similar, in all respects, to other Mega Man games; however, this is the first time that you get a sidekick. It's also the first time you're allowed to slide instead of merely walking. Also, there is a mysterious character called Protoman who may or may not be your friend.\n\nRush is your dog who helps out by offering other modes of transportation when you need it. He starts out with the 'Rush Coil' ability to launch you to the top of the screen like a springboard; later he acquires the 'Rush Jet' ability to turn into a guided, floating platform to carry you wherever you need to go; and he also gets the 'Rush Marine' ability which is a submarine that works just like the jet except underwater and with the added ability to hop around out of the water(you can actually jump while on the jet but the jet continues to hover beneath you whereas you stay inside the submarine). All of these abilities function just like boss weapons.\n\nHow do those work, you ask? When you defeat the boss at the end of a level you gain his power - or at least a similar power. You may pause the game at any time and switch to any single power you have. It supplants your regular Arm Cannon with a limited - but superior - ability. The weapon ammo is displayed next to your energy meter. There are 8 of these, corresponding to the 8 main levels, even though there are 21 levels in the entire game. The bosses are as follows: Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man, Top Man, Magnet Man, & Hard Man.\n\nEnemies will often supply you with both energy and ammo refills. You can also collect Energy Tanks which can only be used once but will entirely restore your health. You'll definitely want some of these for Dr. Wily's fortress, if not for the levels before it, since you start the game with only 3 lives. There are even Surprise Boxes lying around for you to find. And, of course, you do get infinite continues and a password feature to resume play at the beginning of any level.",

At the forefront of this technology is Dr. Light and his assistant Dr. Wily, who are commissioned to build six robots to handle a variety of specific tasks. They are named Bombman, Gutsman, Iceman, Cutman, Elecman, and Fireman in reference to their individual prime functions. Dr. Wily, however, has bigger plans and chooses to take control of the robots and let loose destruction in a bid for world control. Dr. Light fights back with the best tool he has, an experimental human-like robot, Rock aka Mega Man, who had been tested to perform cleaning duties. Now properly armed, it's up to Mega Man to take on the maverick robots, fight his way into Dr. Wily's castle, and end this madness.\n\nMega Man is a side-scrolling platformer. Mega Man has the ability to jump and fire his weapon. He must travel to the levels of the six robot masters and defeat them in combat. By doing so, Mega Man is able to acquire their power for his own. These powers can then be used interchangeably with his main weapon and target the weaknesses of specific enemy bosses. Additionally, some hidden areas of the levels can only be accessed by using certain captured robot weapons. A special  Magnet Beam ability can also be found which can be used to create steps. \n\nTravelling throughout these levels, Mega Man is confronted by an army of lesser robot creations. Destroying these usually yields energy capsules (for refilling Mega Man's Energy), weapon capsules (for refilling Mega Man's special robot weapons), and extra lives shaped like Mega Man's head.",

        "desc": "Rocman X (also known as Thunder Blast Man) is an unlicensed game created by Sachen, released on the Famicom and NES sometime in the 90's and also sometime later for the Game Boy Color. The NES and English Game Boy Color versions were released as Thunder Blast Man, the Chinese version of the GBC game released as Rockman X Gold, and one of the NES versions' label calls it Thunder Blaster Man. \nRocman X's title screen is mostly copied from the first Famicom game of Rocman's, with the logo taken from Rocman X. The game also includes a story in English where Gadem City celebrates its centennial before the mayor's daughter, Miss Lucy, is kidnapped by the Paulung-Tang gang, who then take over and sabotage the city, holding it for a $20 billion ransom. Thunder Blast Man himself (also commonly known as Rocman X) appears to be based on Rocman/Mega Man and bears a passing resemblance to Quickman from Mega Man 2, as well as sporting a cape.  His default weapon is a boomerang as opposed to a standard Mega Buster, and only one can be thrown on screen at a time. You can get different weapons as well as buy a spare continue (if you don't have one) by visiting stores located before boss fights in each world, save for the motorcycle stage. As well as this, Thunder Blast Man has a charge move triggered by holding B and, after it fully charges (designated by the health bar flashing) releasing it while holding up, left, or right to fly in that direction (releasing it while being still cancels the move.)  This allows him to get across many pits throughout the game. \nThe first three areas are available on the stage select screen, and most stages (save for the fourth area, where the boss is fought at the end of a single motorbike area) are split into two parts and a boss each.  After clearing these, the game becomes linear as you access the last three areas automatically in order.  The fourth area is a motorbike chase scene which looks and plays somewhat similarly to the speedboat sequence towards the end of Wave Man's stage in Mega Man 5. If you die in a stage you can continue from the point that you left off at (assuming you have a continue; you always start a new game with a continue) but if you used it up or don't have one you have to restart at the stage you're currently on, losing your bought weapons in the process.  This is a bit different in the mine cart segment of the final world, as falling into the spikes give you a game over regardless of health or continues, but you restart the level with your on-hand items (spare continue and/or weapons) intact.  The ending explains that Thunder Blast Man has saved Gadem City from the Paulung-Tang gang and that the city has made a statue of him.",

The anim\u00e9 (and the game) tells the story of the noble Bronze Saints who have to save the goddess Athena, the only benevolent deity among the rivaling Greek gods. In the game, you control four Bronze Saints: Pegasus Seiya, Cygnus Hyoga, Dragon Shiryu, and Andromedus Shun. At specific parts of the game, you'll have to choose a specific character in order to trigger a story-related event. \n \nThe gameplay is split into side-scrolling action and RPG-like turn-based fights. During the side-view sequences you travel through short levels, beating up goons who are trying to stop you, jumping and trying not to fall into the abyss. You accumulate experience points, called \"Seven Senses\", which you can then distribute to raise your HP or Cosmo Power. Cosmo is a kind of energy you need to perform an attack, and it decreases the more you fight. In the end of a level, a boss usually awaits you, whom you fight in turn-based style, performing punches and kicks.",

Emperor Hans sends his troops to deal with this threat, but they are no match for the ultimate evil one. As an alternative, the emperor summons the bearers of 4 Magical Bells. These 4 adventurers must make their way to the castle and work as a team if they are to destroy Ta-Keed.\n\nThe first part of Little Samson has each of the 4 characters journeying from his or her home land to the emperor's palace. This gives the player an opportunity to explore that character's unique abilities which will be essential throughout the game.\n\n1. Samson is a human who is reasonably fast and also possesses magnificent rock climbing prowess. He is able to scale walls and hang across ceilings, and also grab onto walls and ceilings while jumping. His offensive option is the ability to shoot bells straight ahead.\n\n2. Kikira is the Dragon Lord. Since she has claws, she does not slip on ice. When she jumps, she can also fly for short bursts. She breathes fire in 2 intensities, depending on how long the player holds down the fire button. Her fireballs spread in arc patterns.\n\n3. Gamm is the Rock Lord. Since he is a living rock he is very strong. So strong in fact that spikes do not hurt him, which is very valuable in a number of situations. He is also very slow and has only a short leap. He has a powerful punch.\n\n4. K.O. is the Mouse Lord. He is tiny which allows him to enter areas that other team members can not. He is also extremely fast and the highest jumper of the team. However, he is the weakest member so he can not sustain very much damage. He has the same wall and ceiling traversal abilities as Samson. Offensively, he can drop time-delay bombs.\n\nWhen all 4 characters reach the emperor's palace, they all jump into Samson's bell. Actually, Gamm and K.O. quietly jump into Samson's bell; Kikira initially refuses. After a brief fight (with the player controlling Samson), Kikira joins the effort. Throughout the rest of the game, the player can switch between any of the 4 characters by entering the sub-screen. Each character has their own power meter. However, all the characters share lives. If the presently selected character loses all of his or her power, then one life is lost. The player must swap between all 4 characters in order to complete the journey.",

The game's objective was to choose the correct character or letter, with six different levels. The first two levels are based on simply choosing the window instructed by Big Bird, while the next two needed memorizing since the windows close. In the fifth level the player had to spell the three-letter word instructed by choosing the right letters and the last level the player must attempt to spell the most number of different words before a time limit, the letters in the windows changing after a new word is created.",

When you hit a block with the pistol, this will move blocks adjacent to the block hit rather than the block itself. If numerous blocks are lined up, the shockwave will continue to travel through the blocks until the path is clear and a block can be moved. Some blocks are indestructable and immovable, while others can be moved, and some completely destroyed. Teleportation doors, force fields and other special items can be found in some mazes. To complete most of the levels the blocks will need to be moved about in the proper order to avoid leaving a critical path permanently blocked. If you do get stuck, there is an option to restart a maze (this feature becomes more and more useful as the game progresses.) Wandering about many of the levels are FireStars which will weaken your spacesuit and eventually destroy it. Each level has a time limit in which to solve the maze and retrieve all of the crystals.",

The newly-promoted Lt. Solid Snake is called back into action to infiltrate the terrorists' base with the help of two FOX-HOUND rookies, former marine Nick Myer and navy intelligence agent John Turner.\n\nThe player once again assume the role of Snake. The objective is similar to the previous game, as the player must avoid any kind of visual contact (even moreso than the first game), while collecting weapons and equipment on-site. There is a greater variety of areas such as a jungle, a warehouse, a train, a couple of prisons and even a cargo ship containing the mass-produced Metal Gears. The player must also overcome new traps such as searchlights, soldiers in gyrocopters, door-sealing devices and even suicide bombers. The player must also interrogate captured enemy officers by injecting them with a truth serum to increase their rank, in addition to saving hostages like in the first game. Side-scrolling areas are also included in addition to the main overhead game, where the game takes a more action-oriented route (while still maintaining the stealth premise).",

Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).",

The goal in each level is to extinguish all flames by pushing or dropping blocks onto them. The player takes control of Dana who can create or destroy ice blocks, climb blocks and push loose blocks. Ice is created diagonally below Dana in the direction that he is facing, if there is already an ice block there, it will be destroyed. However, ice blocks cannot be created on a spot that is already occupied by a flame, so that the player will often have to find a way to create ice blocks next to or above a flame so that they can be pushed or dropped onto it. If an ice block is created next to another object or wall it will stick to it, meaning it can't be moved and won't fall down. It is therefor also possible to create ice bridges to get over chasms. When a loose ice block is pushed, it slides above the ground until it hits another object. Rocks can also be used to extinguish flames, but they are indestructible and only move one space when pushed (unless they are on an icy surface).",

This pumpkin king kidnaps Jennifer and Rick barely has the time to wipe off the dust from his clothes before he sets off to rescue his girlfriend.\n\nAlthough the game is not as gory as the other titles, there is still plenty of disturbing enemies such as headless chickens, severed hands and zombies. Through seven side-scrolling levels, including a graveyard, a mansion, a Japanese pagoda and an Egyptian pyramid, you chase the pumpkin king with your cleaver and a shotgun you can pick up along the road. Just like the other games in the series, there are lots of movie references. The game often needs good timing and pixel perfect jumps, as falling down from platforms will regenerate the enemies.

Then imprison the human creatures in underwater factories where they can be turned into a fresh source of man-ham.\n\nThe plan goes perfectly. The leaders of earth's nations are taken completely by surprise as the ice-caps melt and the globe is flooded. It seems that humanity will meet its end on the dinner plates of the Neptunian monsters. But wait! One hope remains, in the form of evil pirate Narikeen, who has been the scourge of the world's nations, pillaging and causing general distress in his pink submarine, Sqoon. The leader of the world's ailing defense force turns to this former public enemy number 1, and with some difficulty manages to convince Narikeen to save the world.\n\nIn this side-scrolling shooter, you control Narikeen's sub, Sqoon. Sqoon is equipped with two weapons; an upgradable missile launcher which shoots straight ahead to take out the weird Neptunian enemies and an ice-bomb which shoots horizontally downwards to blow up factories and other installations. Destroying these buildings releases the humans inside, who then float out so you can rescue them. When you have nine people on-board, a small mobile island will appear on the surface, allowing you to drop off the humans and re-fuel. You'll need to save a lot of people and re-fuel regularly, as your sub only lasts about 60 seconds on one tank of gas. There are eight levels in the game, each set in a different (sunken) country.",

Suddenly, a spaceship crashes before them! \"Lettuce check it out,\" urges Maru. From the ship appears a man dressed as a king. \"I yam King Kale,\" he says, \"Won't you peas peas help me?\" Yes, the flaccid puns start to fly from this point and don't let up until the very end of the game. Those expecting witty dialogue from this game obviously have never spoken to a game programmer before. \n \nIt seems that King Kale needs the pair's help to prevent six worlds from being dominated by a mysterious being known as Vegetron. Every hero needs a nemesis, right? Unfortunately, despite managing to look almost evil in a cute way, Vegetron fails to come across as a threat to our heroes. One wonders how he even managed to dominate his back garden, let alone six planets, with his army of cute robots and \"vegetable-themed\" guardian minions, the latter of which are vulnerable in the same spots and which can be dispatched with almost the same pattern on each world. This is the same Vegetron who, after a single defeat at the hands of Maru, realizes the error of his ways and chooses to turn over a new leaf in a platitudinous soliloquy which goes on and on. That puts an end to Veggie's chances of reappearing in sequels without some kind of contrived plot twist. \n \nOur two heroes, then, set off on an adventure to save the kings imprisoned by the boss guardians on each of the six worlds. This being a platform game, each world has its own theme and pitfalls that need to be dealt with. These include the anti-gravity of the Space Fortress, fire pits of the Hot Pepper Planet, black holes of the Star-Spngled [sic] Squash, and requisite icy madness of the Frozen Vegetable Section. There is also a seventh world where the final battle with Vegetron takes place.",

You should make your way through platform levels populated with wild animals and other foes. Some of the levels are impassable or serve no purpose, others contain valuable clues and useful items. You can also visit town areas and talk to people. There is a variety of weapons to be found during your quest, including \"native\" ones such as blowpipe and spear. ",

Your terrain is infinite, and your enemies will re-appear in your radar every time they fly out of range. You fly in different locations, such as the Middle East, Alaska, the Pacific, etc. During flight, you can also turn off the music and play with only the flight sounds.\n\nYour mission is to defeat a fixed number of enemies each mission. Your targets will always be aerial ones. You can shoot a cannon (which ammunition is unlimited) or missiles (8 per mission). If an enemy shoots you a missile, you can try to avoid it using the stealth mode (pressing the start button) once per mission. The stealth mode will automatically turn off once you pass out of the danger. If you manage to accomplish the mission perfectly, a bonus round is offered, and you have to try to take down as many enemies as you can.\n\nThe game can be played by one or two player taking turns. A second player can also take control of the aircraft closest to the center of the radar, either in one or two player mode.",

So if the player wanted to pass to a teammate, the character on screen would have to be facing the person to which he's passing. The same applied to shooting at the net and attempting to score a goal. The character would have to be facing the opposing net. A player without the puck could only skate faster. If the goalie had control of the puck, he could only pass to a teammate. \n \nAs in the real-world sport of hockey, the object is to score more goals than the opposing team.",

His primary weapon is his jumping ability and sword, the Cypher, which he uses to strike with great speed. At some point in the game, the Cypher may be modified to shoot plasma arrows. Hiryu also has a various set of \"skills\" which he learns as he gains levels. Examples of skills are a healing ability (Medical), a jumping ability (Jump), some additional attacks (Spark, Fire, Sp-Ball) and the ability to leave an area (Warp).",

        "desc": "Sugoro Quest is a genre-bender of a game. It's an RPG, but yet it has many board game elements. It may sound like a strange combination, but it works surprisingly well. It almost comes off as a tabletop RPG simulation.nnnnThe back-story is fairly simple. The Kingdom of Siland is plagued with various problems, all of which involve monsters living in caves wreaking havoc on the countryside. Of course, what kind of game would it be if there weren't fearless heroes to step in and fix things? That's where the four Dice Heroes step in. The four Dice Heroes will, of course, be under your control.nnnnThe four Dice Heroes are your basic stock-issue fantasy characters. There's the fighter, he's got a moderately high amount of strength, and a decent balance of everything. There's the dwarf, who's got plenty of strength and endurance, but he's dumb as a brick. There's the elf, who's really good at magic but has no HP and very little strength. Then there's the half-elf, who's fair and balanced. You must pick one of these characters before each level, and you're stuck with them until you finish.nnnnNow, all of this may sound cliche, and you'd be correct. But all the cliches in the story are offset but the offbeat game play. Each area is made up of a path that is predetermined for the most part. Every time you move, you roll a die and move that many spaces. Some squares trigger events, which range from encounters with townsfolk, to warp tiles, to healing spring, and more. Some squares have multiple exits, and the one you end up using depends on which character you are, or how you answer a certain question. Any square without an event leads to a battle.nnnnBattle is a bit different compared to most NES role-playing games. You face monsters one-on-one, and each side rolls a die. The side that rolls the higher number gets a number of attack equal to the difference between the die rolls. So if you roll a four and the monster rolls a two, you get two attacks. The loser gets to sit there and take it. In the even of the tie, you keep the tying roll and roll again. The winner of that roll gets to attack, and the defender loses their defenses. Using magic operates on the same principal.nnnnBasically, each level continues like this until you either die, or you reach the cave where the boss resides. Then you can go back to the castle, buy some gear, and get your next assignment, until you finish the game.nnnnIf you're looking for an NES role-playing game that's a welcome departure from Dragon Warrior and Final Fantasy clones, this game is right up your alley.",

Most cancelled games saw months' worth of publicity in video game magazines before fading off the game-watch radars. The gameplay is very similar to Sunsoft's Batman games, Batman and Batman: Return of the Joker, in that the character can run, jump, punch and duck, although in this game the player can also fly simply by pushing up. There are also some side scrolling flying levels where you can shoot laser/heat vision from your eyes. The game is divided into five scenes with one-four areas with a boss at the end of each area. \n \nThe game features a superhero, named Sunman. He is very reminiscent of Superman with his cape, and flying abilities, as well as the games title screen seems to match that of the Superman logo. Sunsoft's involvement with other DC Comics character licenses lead some to speculate that Sunman was intended to be a Superman game, but DC for whatever reason decided not to go along and the game had some changes made to lose the likeness. In an interview with planner/director Kenji Eno, it was confirmed that this was originally intended to be a Superman game.",

Towns also contain people who will give clues and information to Jack & Ryu.\n\nWhen bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack & Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills acquired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.\n\nLittle Ninja Brothers also features a field meeting mode where Jack and Ryu compete in a variety of sports themed events themed around a foot race. The different modes available for this competition include: a regular Dash, Popping Baloons, Athletic Obstacle Course, Finding a treasure hidden inside rocks, Eating food attached to balloons and finally, Shooting targets with projectiles.",

Each ninja has the ability to move in any of four directions: up, down, left and right, as well as punch directly in front of them and do a \"Moon Sault Kick\" (which can be powered up to a \"Miracle Kick\") whereby they jump and somersault directly in front. Both punches and the Moon Sault Kick can harm enemies. Defeating a certain number of enemies on each level will open the doorway into the next level. Occasionally extra passages (named \"Quick Passage Zone\") can be found to take shortcuts through areas with stronger enemies. At times, defeated enemies will leave power-ups behind which either player can collect in order to increase their abilities temporarily. While power-ups are diverse, here are examples of some of the effects: weakening specific enemies, invincibility, increased attack, extra lives and the ability to use projectile attacks. ",

Later stages switch the moles with other animals and characters to quickly bop. \nThe game was released with a rubber mallet and a special smaller Power Pad peripheral (known in Japan as the Family Trainer) with a grid of buttons that corresponded to the holes that the moles would emerge from. Because the Power Pad had twelve buttons, the different stages could be configured differently: for instance, the first level had a ring of eight buttons on the right side of the pad, whereas the next level included the left, right, and bottom row of buttons to form its eight around an island in a U shape.",

After Namco excited the market for baseball games with the release of Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, many other companies attempted to meet the demand for more baseball games. \n \nThis title differentiated itself from other baseball games by obtaining permission from the Professional Baseball Organization of Japan to use the official names of the 12 Japanese baseball teams and their players. This was a groundbreaking feature at the time. It was also the first game to depict an existing stadium with it's actual name, the Tokyo Dome, which had just opened shortly before the game's release. Outfielder and first baseman Warren Cromartie, formerly with the Montreal Expos, and playing for the Yomiuri Giants at the time, was chosen to help promote the game. \n \nTo further distinguish the game, the developers chose to use a more realistic approach when depicting the players on the field, as opposed to the more cartoonish look utilized by Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and many other baseball games. Additionally, the view remains fairly close to the ball after the batter hits the ball, as opposed to zooming out to a bird's eye view of the field. Despite these changes, and efforts to promote the game, it was considered very difficult to play, as it employed rather complex controls for batting, pitching, and fielding that were not easy for many players to perform.",

Instead, the game consists of four stages. In the first stage, you control Bug-tte Honey, who has the ability to fly about the screen. At the end of the first stage, Honey rescues Takahashi by smashing the cage he is being held captive in. From that point forward, the player controls Takahashi (Called Master Higgins in the US/EU version)",

Various people and shop-owners can be spoken with, and frequently attacked if the player so chooses.nnnnKitano incorporated many of his unique and controversial ideas into the game. For instance, the player can beat up a yakuza gangster at a pachinko gambling establishment, and take the yakuza's money to exchange for prizes. The player can use a hang-glider to fly over into a strange land called the \"Red Country\" (an amalgam between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany). The player can gain access to the Red Country if they pass over the four other islands, but a huge mountain blocks the way into the country, and the player will be forced to crash into either the mountain or the ground, resulting in an automatic game over screen. There is also a choice on the password-entry screen (\"Punch the old man\") which results in an automatic game over, even when the player has not even started the game. Other in-game events include: a game over screen where the player's character is given a funeral, singing karaoke at a pub (using the second-controller's built-in microphone), the main character divorcing his wife and paying a settlement, beating up yakuza, or even punching the main character's wife and children (presumably to death).nnnnThe game's plot, where a despondent salaryman seeks to find a hidden treasure on an island, is introduced as having been created by Kitano while he was drunk at a bar; however, Kitano himself explains that the plot was solely the result of an hour-long talk at a caf\u00e9 near his production company",

One happy ending and four unhappy endings were used in the game; becoming one of the first video games to have multiple endings. The game was not very successful, but it started appearing frequently and getting high prices on online auction sites like Yahoo! after 2000, when Masashi Tashiro was arrested and convicted several times in connection with voyeurism and drug abuse.",

Press down, and Magnus transforms into a trailer. In trailer mode, he can pass below the planes as well as shoot upwards. When a plane is shot down, it transforms into a robot, which must be killed with the forward-pointing shot. Later on, the game becomes more platform-oriented.",

While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they are largely driven by menus.

Player graphics are large and colorful, which is made possible by limiting the number of players to nine per team.  Animated cut-scenes are shown following touchdowns and at half-time, and crowds are shown filling the endzone seats.\n\nThere are four plays to choose from on offense--usually two runs and two passes. The player takes control of the quarterback before the snap and then either hands off to the running back or works through his receiver progression from the top to the bottom of the screen.  Defense consists of trying to guess which offensive play the opponent will select and then taking control of one of the defensive players before the snap.  A very simple power meter system is used for kicking field goals, extra points, and punts.\n\nThere are no game or season stats and there is no way to save your season, but there is a password feature allowing you to resume tournament play where you left off.",

Depending on the version of the game, up to two, three or four players can take part in the action. The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous. At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).\n\nThe NES version of the game features additional content not present in other versions of the game: two new levels (Snowy Central Park and The Dojo), new bosses (including Tora, Shogun and Baxter Stockman as a fly), additional music tracks as well as more variations of Foot Soldiers.

Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.\n\nTetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.\n\nBomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.\n\nBomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.",

Meanwhile, the company worked rapidly behind the scenes to override Nintendo's infamous lockout device that kept unofficial cartridges from being played on its console. When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked. Today, the game known as Tengen Tetris is a rare title to have in your collection, but it's a worthwhile play. After all, Tetris is one of the classic games not only on the NES, but of all-time.",

Capcom planned to publish the game in 1990 but its release was canceled due to the California Raisins' dwindling popularity because of the decline in raisin sales in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the single-player side-scrolling action game the player controls a California Raisin through five stages in an effort to rescue the band and their band's musical notes that were stolen by the gang of jealous musicians. The player walk, jump, climb on vines, moonwalk (by pressing the \"select\" button) and shoot an unlimited supply of grape jelly beans as projectiles. As was the case with other Capcom games, such as Mega Man and DuckTales, one can play the first four levels in any order that you want, but the final level is only available after you have collected the musical notes from each of the four levels. The first four levels include The Grape Vine, The Factory, The Maize Maze and The Juicery. The final level takes places in The Clouds. During each level you can collect 'I' icons that give you temporary invincibility, regular black musical notes for bonus points, 'Sunshine' icons to restore your health, and 'Raisinette' icons to give an extra life to the player. One can also locate items by shooting at the thin air or at columns.",

You're not too sure where he might be, but a dungeon is always a good place to look, so you seek out the nearest one and plunge into its depths. Beware: 8 levels of \nisometric death await.\n\nThe Immortal is the prototype of a trial-and-error game. Progress is made by encountering a hazard, dying, solving the problem, encountering the next hazard. To solve a level, you have to know its traps and their patterns by heart. As frustrating as this may sound (it is), The Immortal quite cleverly balances annoyance with curiosity and graphical rewards. In short: You want to see what challenge lies in the next room.\n\nThe puzzles range from simple avoidance of traps to the correct use of items; you collect objects in an inventory. Every now and then, The Immortal surprises with a special challenge. For example, you've got to ride a magic carpet through a hallway full of fire traps, or ride a barrel on an underground river. The dungeon isn't empty: some friedlies may have valuable information or trade items, the nasty sort of guys will attack. Combat is fought man-to-man on a special screen. Your adversary indicates his next attack a few seconds before he executes it, so you've got time to react appropriately. You can dodge to the left or the right, as well as attack from these two directions. There is no save option in the game, of course, but you may restart each level as often as you like. Levels can be skipped by entering passwords.",

Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.\n\nThe game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. \n\nLink's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. \n\nThere are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. \n\nTo find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. \n\nIf Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the \"2nd quest\", which is essentially a harder version of the game. \n\nThe Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.",

The outlaw, whose name is Butch Cavendish, has now kidnapped the President. The time has come for the masked man to begin his journey of adventure for the purpose of safely rescuing the President and avenging the deaths of his brother and former comrades.\n\nThe game takes you through 8 western-themed regions, each \nwith a different objective, all of which brings you closer to your nemesis, Butch Cavendish. The game features many points of view during gameplay. Most of the time, the game is played from a top-down perspective, as you travel through the country and walk through towns. At other times, the game switches to a side scrolling view when you are in a boss stage. On occasion, the view switches to a first person perspective and plays similar to a first person shooter.\n\nEach bad guy you kill is worth money. You can use money to buy more bullets, dynamite, rifles or a patch up from a doctor. For example, you start with a short barreled gun which you can upgrade to either a medium or long barreled gun. Your gun shoots standard bullets but can also fire silver bullets which are stronger than the standard ones.",

Cook. \n\nIf Tiki doesn't rescue a kiwi in a limited amount of time, the devil will appear and try to kill her. When Tiki reaches the outskirts of each city, except Strait Cook, there is a boss waiting to meet Tiki, and kill her by using their own choice of weapons. Also making the rescue mission difficult are several nasties that attempt to throw their own weapons, like bombs and arrows, at her. To defeat these enemies, Tiki shoots at them using her crossbow and arrows. More often than not, when Tiki shoots at enemies, they will leave behind pieces of fruit that she can pick up for points. However, it is likely that Tiki may get other weapons or the letters E, X, T, E, N, and D. Collecting all these letters will result in an extra life, and as for the weapons, they include laser shots, bombs, and fireballs. \n\nIn some levels, a few areas are located further up than just left or right, and the only way that Tiki can go up is by snatching something off the enemy that gives her the ability to fly up. Other areas are underwater, and when Tiki goes underwater, her oxygen  meter decreases, so she has to rise up to the surface again to restore her oxygen levels.

He also has to collect enough \"proof\" of the aliens existence (brown coins left behind when they are jumped on), so his family members will help him when he meets a boss (characters such as Nelson and Sideshow Bob). This won't be easy since the Space Mutants are \"using\" human bodies as disguise. In order to discover who are the real Space Mutants, Bart must use his X-ray Specs.\n\nThe ways Bart can get rid of those objects sought by the Space Mutants are numerous. For instance, in the first stage, Bart must get rid of purple objects. He can dye them red, cover them, wash them, etc. Some even involve a little puzzle solving, like playing a trick on Moe to make him get out of the bar.\n\nBart also has some coins that can be used in many ways throughout the game, like buying things, getting devices operating, etc. Those coins are essential to solve some puzzles in the game.

The game has a variety of different gameplay types. The stages go in the order of an overhead view stage, a side-scrolling stage, a climbing stage with the Android boss, and then a bomb disposal stage.\n\nThe overhead view stages deal with you driving either a car, boat, glider, or a dune buggy and trying to get to the end before time runs out on the clock. You must do this while either dodging or shooting enemies. In all the stages besides the one where you're given a glider you can use a limited number of turbo boosts to speed up your vehicle. In the glider stages you can alter your altitude to either go high above or below various obstacles. All of these levels end with a boss battle.\n\nSometimes after these stages there is a bonus round where you try to collect extras in a limited amount of time without crashing into any obstacles. Completing this successfully will yield an extra life.\n\nThe side-scrolling stages consists of two different experiences. One is a platformer where you walk around and can shoot enemies while searching for a set number of keys to unlock a forcefield at the end of the stage. The other consists of you flying a glider throughout a stage shooting enemies and trying not to crash until you get to the end of the stage.\n\nThe climbing stages consist of you climbing a building and shooting enemies with a reticle that you can move all over the screen.You have to get to the top of the building before time runs out. Once at the top you will have to fight an android boss. Such as Mega Slug, Techno Beast, and the Sand Yeti. The android boss fights take place on the buildings rooftops with a side view of the action. The player must drain the energy from the androids by repeated shooting bullets into them.\n\nIn the bomb disposal stage you must dispose of a bomb before the fuse burns all the way detonating it. You dispose the bomb by unsoldering chips away from each other. The player must use the directional pad to move the cursor from chip to chip keeping an eye on the number on each one. Every time the cursor moves to a certain block, the number on it decreases by one. This creates a puzzle-like scenario, where if the player makes a mistake he must reset the disposal and try again with less time.",

They are simple in nature, and relatively easy to learn how to play, so it is a fun break from the more complex games out there. In any event, there are only card games here, so if that is not your thing, move on, otherwise check this out. \n \n",

The forces are The Flash of Chance (allows symmetry to affect any matching tiles on the board, even those surrounded by other tiles), The Force of Balance (will eliminate brick walls that block the path of symmetry) and The Flag of Knowledge (this will make your next move for you in case you can't spot what the best move is.)

Depending on the mission, different kinds of targets must be destroyed. There are always enemy aircraft, but some missions include sea and ground targets as well. Two weapons are available: machine guns (with unlimited ammunition) and missiles. The player can choose from three types of missiles before a mission: the more powerful ones can only be carried in lower quantities.\n\nEnemy aircraft either overshoot the players's plane from behind and can be easily taken down, or they come from the front and fire guns and missiles. Sometimes, an enemy plane will position itself on the player's six. It should be lost quickly by steering left and right, or instant death follows.\n\nHalfway through missions two through four comes a refueling sequence where the fuel plane's nozzle must be aligned with one's aircraft.\n\nEvery mission (except the first one) features a final mission target, which can take a lot more damage than regular targets.\n\nEach mission concludes with a landing attempt on the aircraft carrier. To successfully land, the player's plane must have a certain altitude and speed. Successfully landing gives bonus points, but crashing the plane doesn't end the game - it simply costs a life.",

Quaid will be chased by henchman Richter in the first level, and must battle his wife inside their apartment. The security x-ray scanner takes up a level, as does the subway battle after. The player will also commandeer a Martian taxi for a driving level inside the colony, and windows can be shot out on Mars, sucking out any unfortunate baddies nearby.",

Your basic weapon is something like an energy ball that can be charged by holding the button for a few seconds until its maximum power. Although Jake is supposed to still be learning his magic from Zebediah, from the very beginning you can use all his magical powers. You can select which magic you want to use from a list, displayed when you press the start button. The magical powers available include healing, time stopping, invincibility, the power of the elements (fire, watter, wind and earth) and 3 different metamorphosis. You can morph into a flying guy who throws something like a boomerang (that doesn't come back), a fish-like guy, who throws something like ninja stars and can swim, and a feline-like guy, who releases electrical shocks from his hands and becomes invincible while jumping. You do not evolve during the game, as your health and magic bar doesn't grow.\n\nTotally Rad, as the name points out, is a game full of slang, with the constant use of words like totally, gnarly, dude, excellent, decent, righteous, etc.",

It also had large, detailed towns with many people to talk to, and a separate combat engine where your party fought multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system. \n \nThe story? After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named \"Exodus\" before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon you the hero to find and stop him.",

        "desc": "Based on the anim\u00e9 series Ushio & Tora, this game tells the story of a boy named Ushio. He lives in a modern-day Tokyo with his father, but his family line stretches back to the samurai days of Japan. Five hundred years ago a demon was terrorizing the land. Ushio's ancestor, wielding a magical spear from China, managed to bind the monster to a rock with an artifact. Unable to kill the demon, he built a temple around it and stayed there as a monk in order to make sure it won't escape. Ushio finds the demon still tied to the rock in the basement of one of the temple buildings. Unfortunately, by breaking the seal on the doors to the basement, Ushio has released the demon's evil energy, which attracts other monsters. Ushio calls the demon Tora, because it reminds him of a tiger (Tora is Japanese for tiger). Tora has to stick with Ushio, because he holds the magical spear, and to help him to defeat his own evil will!\n\nThe game plays like a traditional console-style RPG, with turn-based battles, where Ushio uses his family magic, and Tora his demonic abilities. You explore Tokyo by moving Ushio around from top-down perspective, and inside houses and dungeons the view switches to first-person, like in early \"interactive fiction\" adventures.\n\nUshio to Tora: Shinen no Daiyo is a Japan-only release and is not the same game as the SNES action title \"Ushio & Tora\".",

His master Dastardly sends his on three different missions, each taking place in a different location, which in its turn is divided into smaller levels. \n\nMuttley has to complete those levels in a rather standard platformer fashion, moving from left to right, jumping, overcoming obstacles and fighting various creatures and boss enemies from the cartoon movie. The dog's primary weapon is, unsurprisingly, his own mouth - biting regular enemies will usually lead to their instant death. Muttley can also collect bones scattered across the levels, which will grant him powerful weapons and skills of limited use, such as a bomb, a projectile attack, and the ability to heal.",

The whole game's pretty frustrating, with the whole ?one-hit-and-you-start-the-entire-level-over? thing that's so popular in the world of videogaming. Honestly, it's fun and all, but I don't understand why the game needed to have two sequels. \n \nWhile this isn't quite as polished as AlanMidas's translation of the first Wagyan Land game (the title screen, for instance, and the GYA syllables that he shoots out are left in Japanese), it's still all in English, and pretty damn fun to play. You can just pretend those projectiles are magical, uh, runes, or something. \n \nJuly 2009 Update \nThe translation is incomplete. Another ending was left untranslated and was even removed if the patch is used (as the author's notes state so). The unofficial addendum released April 2008 only added additional graphics, but the ending is missing.",

The players take turns spinning a wheel that has designated money amounts in most spaces, but can also bankrupt the player in the wheel lands on the wrong space. A player can guess a letter and if that letter is in the puzzle, those spaces are flipped to reveal the letter and the player earns the cash amount specified by the wheel spin, multiplied by the number of occurrences of the letter. Only English consonants can be guessed-- the 5 English vowels can be purchased using a player's earnings.\n\nThis NES edition of the game allows 1, 2, or 3 human players to play against each other. Human players can also elect to play against computer players and at 3 difficulty levels. \n\nThe Vanna White Edition differs from previous Wheel of Fortune games on the NES in that it actually bears the likeness of Vanna White. Also, there are avatars for the player contestants, and the wheel animation is different. ",

But now nature itself seems to be attacking the land of Llylgamyn, as earthquakes and tidal waves ravage the land. The Sages believe the Orb of Scrying is the city's salvation, but it is guarded by the dragon L'kbreth. A band of explorers must once again venture forth in search of the Orb. \n \nLegacy of Llylgamyn is the third entry in the Wizardry series. Like its predecessors, it is a first-person dungeon-crawling role-playing game in which the player assembles a party of up to six characters and explores a large maze-like dungeon, fighting randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat and occasionally returning to the game's only town to rest, buy supplies, and outfit the characters. Characters must be imported from either the first or the second game.  \n \nCharacter classes, combat system, and overall gameplay mechanics are very similar to those of the two previous games. Good, evil and neutral alignment, however, plays a larger role. While the first level of the dungeon is accessible to everyone, the other five levels impose alignment restrictions, requiring the party either to have at least one good or bad character, or contain no neutral characters.",

In fact, after the mighty battle with the hero Kuros, Malkil retreated to a nearby self-contained castle kingdom and conducted a hostile takeover. Kuros comes on the scene and must attempt to relieve Malkil of his ill-gotten command of the kingdom, its subjects, and especially its princesses.\n\nThe third game in the Wizards & Warriors NES franchise features a similar feel to the first two games in that Kuros' movements are very quick and nimble. The player also has the ability to control Kuros' sword swing movements. However, Kuros has three different character classes to alternate between-- the knight, the thief, and the wizard. Each represents trade-offs between speed, attack strength, and defense strength. There are various guilds throughout the game devoted to training knights, thieves, and wizards where the player must complete challenging obstacle courses in order to increase their character class level.\n\nThe gameplay proceeds up a large vertical city/castle with dangerous, monster-filled hallways and caverns. Kuros must kill monsters, gather money, buy goods and services, raise his character class levels, rescue a variety of apprehended princesses and gather special jewels, all in a quest to face off with Malkil once again.

A season consists of sixteen races, each one consisting of unlimited practice, one qualifying lap and the real race (the starting position depends on the qualifying result). Of course the goal is to win the championship by having successful race results. Those results also change the amount of \"set-up points\", which represent the quality of the car, players can use before the next race. Besides the championship there is also a time trial mode available (with or without AI opponents). \n \nWhile the game features manual gear switching, it tends more to an action oriented gameplay than a simulation: pit stops (needed when the car gets nearly destroyed after accidents) stop the time for every driver and players can use a limited amount of turbo boosts. Players can start their own racing team or play as Al Unser Jr., which results in always having the best car possible.",

In Xexyz, humans, spirits and faeries have lived peacefully for centuries under the reign of King Xeu Star. One day, Xexyz is attacked by Goruza who murders the king, builds mechanical castles on each island and captures the queen of each island. You take on the role of a soldier named Apollo who wants to put an end to Goruza's reign.\n\nControlling Apollo, it is your task to free all five islands. Freeing an island is done in several different phases that feature 'Jump'n Shoot' as well as 'Shooter' levels (called \"Action Mode\" and \"Shooting Mode\"). The first level of each island is a Jump'n Shoot level that contains many doors to shops, bonus games, friendly NPCs or mid-bosses. NPCs will sometimes give you important hints, items or weapons; bonus games can be played to win some money (\"Balls\"); defeating mid-bosses (and thereby freeing a Fairy) will get you a cash reward and shops also offer weapons and items. Weapons differ largely in attack power and range. Items have temporary effects such as invincibility or improved jumping abilities. In an island's first level, you will have to find a secret room and defeat a boss, for which you will receive a Force Star that is needed to gain access to a mechanical castle. Mechanical castles look similar to other Jump'n Shoot levels but are more complex.\n\nOnce you have made your way to a \"Cyborg Rider\", a self-scrolling Shooter sequence starts in which you have to shoot your way through lots of enemies while picking up speed and weapon power-ups.\nAt the end of this sequence you will leave the Cyborg Rider, and step onto a floating platform for a boss fight. After the boss is defeated, another Shooter sequence with another boss at the end awaits, but this time, the boss if fought from the Cyborg Rider. After defeating this boss, you start the process over with a Jump'n Shoot level. \n",

This game however, throws in a bit of a Castlevania type theme. You mostly travel upward and not side to side like most similar side scrolling games. This contributes to making the game more difficult than the others. It also has a added twist that you have to work your way around obstacles, lines of fire that come out the floor, and many other things. You collect keys, bombs, and other items of which I am not sure where you use them because I didn't make it that far. All in all it is a fun game, though a very challenging one.",

        "desc": "In one of the darkest times in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a young, pointy-eared boy named Link takes on an epic quest to restore the fragmented Triforce of Wisdom and save the Princess Zelda from the clutches of the evil, power-hungry Ganon.\n\nThe Legend of Zelda for the NES marks the first action-adventure title of the popular Nintendo series. Players must make their way through the various forests, graveyards, plains, and deserts of the Overworld to find the secret entrances of the eight dungeons in an attempt to piece together the broken Triforce. Once all pieces are joined, Link will be able to gain entry to Death Mountain, home of Ganon, and prison of Princess Zelda.\n\nThe game is drawn in a top-down perspective. Link begins his quest in the Overworld, which features forests, mountains and lakes and is divided into several screens. Link can explore the Overworld freely, though when he enters a screen, he will encounter several enemies. He can attack them with his sword. If link is at full health, he can toss his sword to attack enemies from afar, but when he is hurt, even slightly, he can only fight in melee range. \n\nLink's health is represented by hearts; initially he can have a maximum of three hearts, but as he progresses in the game, he will find heart containers that increase his maximum health. The enemies are varied - some attack from up close, some shoot projectiles. When killed, they often leave behind an item - a heart to restore energy, rupees that function as money (and can be used to buy stuff in various shops in the Overworld), or bombs which can be picked up and set down to attack enemies or destroy some walls. When enemies are killed, they stay dead and will not re-appear once the screen is entered again. \n\nThere are other items to find in the game; some function as weapons, while others are used to solve puzzles. \n\nTo find the Triforce pieces, Link must explore dungeons. Once he finds an entrance to the dungeon and goes in, he must explore the rooms, fight enemies and collect keys until he finds the boss monster he must defeat. He will then be able to pick up a Triforce piece. Once he does so, however, all the monsters in the Overworld come back to life. \n\nIf Link dies on his quest, he can continue it; he will go back to his start position in the Overworld, but with the items he managed to collect so far. When Link finishes his quest, the pl;ayer can choose to play the \"2nd quest\", which is essentially a harder version of the game. \n\nThe Legend of Zelda is known for several factors that were revolutionary at the time: A full world that could be freely explored, power-ups that would permanently enhance your character's abilities, and a battery back-up save feature that allowed players to retain their progress instead of having to start over. The gameplay balanced out frequent action sequences with discovery, secrets, and exploration.",
