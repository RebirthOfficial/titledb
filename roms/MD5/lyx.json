Luckily, the girls are able to leave behind pages of the band's latest song as a trail for Bill and Ted to follow.\n\nPlaying as either Bill or Ted (with a friend able to take control of the other character over ComLynx), the player must search historical periods in an overhead perspective and collect enough musical notes to open travel to a new area. Along the way, they can encounter historical figures who will offer assistance in return for a favor.  Bad guys do populate the levels, but can be pacified with a rippin' guitar solo.  If Bill or Ted are defeated, they simply reappear back at the last checkpoint.\n\nOther items can be found and collected in an inventory. The Lynx title makes use of the series' interesting take on the time continuum, allowing the player to leave items for themselves in the past to collect and use in the future.  Likewise, if the player happens upon a sudden fortuitous item that \"they\" left, they must remember to go and leave the item in the past themselves to avoid creating a time paradox. This quirky view of time forms the basis of many of the game's puzzles.\n\nA password system is constantly updated (viewable at the pause screen) to save the player's progress.",

The game can be played by one to four players simultaneously.

The story: a crystal falls from the sky and lands in a castle, and it must be retrieved from within its 40 mazes type area. A year later U.S. Gold and Tengen would release another completely different game called Gauntlet III: The Final Quest.",

You will see traffic on the road both in your direction and coming down the opposite direction, so be careful when you pass... \n\nThe course has two sections: speed track, and stunt track. Speed track is longer, but you can usually achieve higher speeds. Stunt track requires you to perform several stunts such as jumping bridges, driving through a loop, and so on. \n\nCrashing the car has no serious consequences and indeed shows a replay of your crash from a cinematic angle. Admire your crash head-on into the cement truck, or clipping the minivan, or flying off the bridge in the wrong angle... You lose several seconds as your car is \"reset\" and you get up to speed again. \n\nThe home conversions retain most of the then-advanced 3D graphics but lack the force-feedback that was in the arcade version.",

Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. \n\nGame B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score. and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.\n\nThe third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again.

One touch from any of these ghosts means a loss of life for Ms. Pac-Man.\n\nMs. Pac-Man can turn the tables on her pursuers by eating one of the four Energizers located within the maze. During this time, the ghosts turn blue, and Ms. Pac-Man can eat them for bonus points (ranging from 200, 400, 800 and 1600, progressively). The Energizer power only lasts for a limited amount of time, as the ghost's eyes float back to their center box, and regenerate to chase after Ms. Pac-Man again.\n\nSurvive a few rounds of gameplay, and the player will be treated to humorous intermissions showing the growing romantic relationship between Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, leading all the way up to the arrival of \"Junior\".",

        "desc": "Power Factor is an action-platformer starring the single campily-named hero, Redd Ace, fighting alien creatures known as the Ceegarians from the Ceeg dimension.  Of course, aliens being played out, the Ceegarians are actually referred to as \"transdimensional intruders,\" and the Ceegarian creatures the player faces off against are referred to as evil invading \"Sinlendo Techmods.\"  \n\nThe primary goal of the game is to work through stages and bosses essentially to build a bomb to destroy the Ceegarians. Pertaining to the bomb, there are six components.  The entire game takes place within, as the box refers to it, \"our dimension's reactor.\"  As such, the environments of the game are aimed to look like the inside of a machine.  To further convolute the storyline, the instruction manual actually refers to the game itself as a Virtual Reality simulation the player is experiencing in the future, based on the exploits of Redd Ace, and you\u2019re meandering through this simulator on the \u201cfamous Atarian Leisure Moon.\u201d  \n\nStages are fairly small, but designed like a maze \u00e0 la Metroid.  However, unlike Metroid, completed areas cannot be revisited.  Each stage ends with a boss battle showcasing enemy characters that are often two screens high.\n\nRedd Ace is armed with a multi-use weapon known as the \"Tmat MOW.\"  Tmat MOW is intended to be short for \u201cTRANSMAT Multi-Ordinance Weapon.\u201d  Four different weapons may be acquired and used for both the A and B buttons, with eight total weapons in the game, and one gun as a standard.  Other weapons include lasers, a flame thrower, missiles, bombs, and the like.  Weapons must be picked up through playing the stages and collecting various weapon icons.  Once the ammunition is used, the weapon is gone and must be recollected.  As such, weapon pick-ups must be used sparingly, especially since most contain very small numbers of ammunition, often as low as two shots.  Choosing weapons is awkwardly assigned to the Directional-pad, which is also where character movement is assigned.  Tapping the D-pad allows the player to select different weapons, while holding it down moves Redd.\n\nControlling Redd Ace is somewhat different from a typical platformer of the era. There is no jump button, as both the A and B buttons have weapons assigned to them.  Instead, our hero is also armed with a levitation pack on his back, which allows flight.  Tapping \"up\" on the D-Pad allows Redd to jump, while holding \"up\" activates the levitator and allows Redd to fly.  Aside from a health bar, there is also a fuel bar showing that flight isn't a luxury to be wasted.  When crouching, Redd automatically aims upwards at a 45-degree angle, rather than straight ahead.\n\nPressing the \"Option 2\" button allows the player to see a menu with information about the bomb pieces the player is collecting, as well as details on the various weapons.  If the player is standing in front of a computer monitor when Option 2 is pressed, the menu shows a map of the current area, and information on enemy characters.\n\nThe player starts with three lives, and there are no continues.  There are, however, three difficulty modes--Easy, Normal, and Hard\u2014which may be selected prior to gameplay.",

Your craft always goes full speed, unless you hit something.  Then you will slow down, but quickly accelerate back to full speed.

The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.",

The action is viewed from behind your helicopter, with the 3D polygon world rotating around you, taking in mountains, rivers and deserts. \n\nThere are 12 missions in total, each of which requires you to destroy targets in a set time limit. There are also training and head-to-head (against a CPU-controlled drone) modes. \n\nYou have a limited number of automatically-targeting missiles as well as a cannon. A tracking map tells you where you are on the level, and where the enemies are.Contact with the ground, mountains or other vehicles will damage or destroy your helicopter.",
