        "desc": "3D MahJongg is a new take on the old game of Mahjong Solitaire (a.k.a. Shanghai Solitaire). It uses the same set of 144 tiles. The object of the game is simple; find two matching tiles that are not blocked by other tiles on either side (up and down is not an option), and slowly whittle away at the layout till all of the tiles have been removed. While simple in practice, the possibilities are endless. \n \nThe game has two sets of rules, Rivers and Classic. In Rivers, tiles must be on the same layer, and the line connecting them may not change direction more than twice. In Classic, tiles must not be covered by other tiles, and must be free to their left or right side. \n \nThe game has two modes: Free Play and Adventure mode which has 200 combinations of the available options you must solve completely before moving forward. There is no basic \"save\" feature, but rather you create a profile, and if you turn off the 3DS it will start you at the next level to be completed when you return to Adventure mode. \n \nThe layout is viewed on the touch screen and the 3D screen. You chose your matching tiles (or the option to rewind or fast forward your moves) on the touch screen, and a 3D representation of the layout is seen on the upper screen. \n \nThe layouts are represented in 3D and with 50 different types, along with six different animated 3D backgrounds called \"Scenes\", as well as six different touch screen backgrounds, and six different tile sets which includes sea creatures, zombies, fantasy characters and traditional playing cards. Like many puzzle games with multiple options, you have to unlock the additional layouts, scenes, backgrounds and tile sets, which is done through Adventure mode.",

        "desc": "Animal Crossing: New Leaf is a social simulation game. The player takes on the role as the new mayor in a small village populated by animals. Gameplay consists of improving the village with new buildings and decorations, collecting furniture and items for one's house, and donating fossils, fish, insects and art to the local museum. \n \nSeveral features in the game make their series debut here, while others have been brought back from older Animal Crossing games after having not been seen in the DS or Wii entries. These include public works projects, which allow new landmarks and buildings to be added to the town, as well as altering the appearance of certain major buildings; the Dream Suite, which allows players to visit other towns in a single-player session; a tropical island that hosts minigames and multiplayer interactions; Re-Tail, a store that acts as a flea market and allows the player to customize certain furniture items with alternate color schemes or patterns; and QR code sharing for player-made clothing and patterns. \n \nA free update, titled Animal Crossing: New Leaf - Welcome amiibo, was released in late 2016. This patch added amiibo functionality, including 64 villagers only available through the use of a corresponding card or figure. 50 of these are villagers who had previously only appeared in the GameCube and/or Nintendo 64 installments of the series; the other 14 are tie-in villagers that represent characters from The Legend of Zelda, Splatoon, Monster Hunter, and Hello Kitty. Other features include new items and currency, an RV campground near the outskirts of town, minigames and features from Animal Crossing spin-off titles, and several miscellaneous features intended for the player's convenience.",

        "desc": "\"Under the sea, under the sea! Darling, it's better down where it's...cough...cough!\" Life under the sea was good but then an oil tanker spilled thousands of gallons of crude oil. Help save the fish! \n \nAtlantic Quest is a match three game. You have three match options to select from. There is the \"swap two items to create a straight line of three or more\" style. There is the chain style where you click and drag your mouse along a line of three or more of the same items, and there is the click on a group of three or more of the same items style. You can swap between styles at any time by selecting it at the bottom. There are fish trapped in green oil bubbles. Below these are blue bubbles with a picture of an item from the board. To release the fish, match the item in the blue bubble. Also on the board are green oil tiles. Make matches over these to clear them. To clear a level, clear all green tiles and free all fish. \n \nAs the game progresses, you will have bonus items, like a bomb that clears some squares and obstacles, like a stone that keeps items from dropping. To clear the stone, make a match next to it. Later, you also have pearls that, if you get them to the bottom of the board, give you a bonus extra. These pearls are: \nOrange: The clownfish: Removes the item and tile from one square, anywhere on the board. \nGreen: The octopus: Shuffles the board. \nBlue: The shark: Randomly removes items and green tiles from the board. Only removes items where there are green tiles. \nRed: The crab: Tosses a stick of dynamite randomly onto the board. It removes a large chuck of items and green tiles. \nIn between stages, you have puzzles. These may be a mixed up picture that you must put in order.",

        "desc": "When you awaken in a mysterious prison you have no idea how you got there or why. Your great-uncle Titus will offer assistance from beyond in freeing you and himself from the puzzles of Azada. Find the pages of the book and you'll both be free. \n \n \nAzada is a multi-puzzle adventure game where you must solve a bevy of different types of puzzles in order to collect painting fragments that will unlock the final puzzles to escape the room. The sorts of puzzles you will have to deal with range from many typical puzzle mini-games such as; a match game where you have to match different butterflies, a symbol-sudoku game, a sequence following game where you must remember the sequence of musical tones played, picture-puzzles where you'll have to use sliders, a game where you'll have to place arrows on the ground in order to lead a robot to the exit,  a game played against the AI where you'll try and complete squares while taking turns laying down lines, a match-stick moving game where you'll have to reduce a number of boxes, mazes, math puzzles and even a tower of Hanoi game.  \n \n \nThe most unique puzzles of the game however are the ones that play similarly to graphic-adventure point-and-click games. You'll be given a stationary picture of a room with three or four objects to find in it. When you find these objects you will use them to uncover the pages of the Azada book in order to move to the next puzzle. For example you will need a pipe segment which you'll need to attach to a pipe you uncover while opening a cupboard and then when the pipe drains a number combination will fall out which you'll enter into a lock-keypad and so on and so forth. \n \n \nThere are over forty different puzzles and puzzles make re-appearances as you play along the game and will get more challenging as you encounter them further along. For example the aforementioned Towers of Hanoi will gradually go from four discs to transfer over to seven discs. There are  five master-level puzzle challenges to move through which are actually the pages of the Azada book where the forty+ puzzles are contained.",

Eventually the towns started to disagree with each other on whose town had the best cooking cuisine. As the villagers became more obnoxious with each other, the Harvest Goddess became more annoyed with them. One day she finally put her foot down and collapsed the tunnel between the towns, cutting them off from each other. Now the only interaction the towns have with each other is at their cooking festival, where their cooking conflict continues four times per season.  \n \nAs a new farmer, you are eager to start your new life at one of the towns but a freak travel accident makes you to forget what town you originally were going to live in! Listen to each mayor's story, hear about each town, and then decide where you want to start your new farm life.",

As Tetsuhiko Kikuchi's influence is heavy here, the game is, in some ways, like a spiritual successor to the aforementioned Saturn title. \n \nCode of Princess follows a typically \"anime\" plot about a princess whose kingdom is being overrun by monsters, and a motley crew of characters that meet and join together to overthrow the evil monsters and the reason the monsters are there.  Primary focus is on the character Solange as she wields a massive sword known as the deLuxcalibur, which is a sacred artifact of sorts for her kingdom.  She is joined by several other characters, most of whom are playable in the story mode of the game. \n \nEach stage is a fairly straight-forward side-scrolling affair more focused on intense combat than any amount of exploration. Each character uses the same basic controls, but all are played very differently.  Many combat moves are performed in a style similar to a fighting game, such as pressing down, towards, and the A or B button.  Players may typically move between 2-4 planes of action on the stage moving forward or back in the 3D space, and doing so is often part of the strategy of moving through levels.  Typically, a note at the top of the screen will give the current objective for the level or individual wave during the level, such as \"defeat all enemies,\" \"defeat the boss\" (which makes the other enemies more of a distraction), \"save a villager,\" or even simply to survive for a set period of time.   \n \nSince levels and missions tend not be be very long they are very numerous and players will find themselves leveling up frequently.  Each level allows the player to assign skill points (generally 5 points) to any of six attributes:  Vitality (life), Piety (maximum magic), Attack, Defense, Mind (magic strength), and Speed.  Various status effects may affect the player throughout the game as well including burning, shock, stone, dark (draining magic), or poison.   \n \nEach main story character not only plays differently, but they level up independently of one another, so that players may choose customize each character differently.  For instance, Solange is naturally a bit slow, but fairly powerful, so a player may build on these strengths adding new speed and ramping up her strength even more.  The character Ali is already pretty fast, so players may want to customize based on that, while other characters are more magic-based, or various combinations of strength, magic, speed, etc. \n \nBesides the regular story missions, there is a Free Play mode that allows players to replay any story mission without lengthy cut scenes or dialog, and there are Bonus missions which unlock parallel to the Story.  Often, they operate as elements to deepen the overall story experience through the gameplay, or simply to add new twists that aren't part of the main story, such as fighting a boss a second time after the boss has, essentially received a \"second wind\" and called in some support.  Bonus Missions also tend to be more challenging, with many of them greatly exceeding the difficulty of the regular story missions, leaving these to be \"pro\" challenges or challenges for those players willing to replay missions enough to level up several times more. \n \nDuring combat, players may lock-on to a single enemy, which allows the player to deal heavier damage to said enemy.  On top of this, activating a Burst gradually drains the magic meter, but also increases all attacks on every enemy.  Combining this with a lock-on allows a player to deal massive damage with every attack.  There is also a shop where players may buy better weapons, armor, and the like--though it is fairly small compared to a traditional RPG. \n \nFinally, the game also uses the Nintendo Network for local and online co-op and versus play, complete with leaderboards.  This mode also allows players to use more than just the main eight main protagonist characters--practically every single enemy character in the game can be unlocked to be used in this mode, from the simplest soldier characters to massive dragons and even boss characters.

        "desc": "For twenty years, Attera has been under attack from monsters spawning from anomalies called Dusk Circles. To fight those monsters, people with the Star God Brand, called Disciples, are gathered and trained in a school in Fort City. The Dusk Circles are said to appear because of mankind's desires. Eight such circles forming the Pandora Labyrinth are known to exist: the original one, which is still inactive, and one for each of the seven deadly sins. The Disciples formed at the Academy are the first line of defense against the monsters, but they cannot enter the labyrinth since the energy inside nullifies their Star Power. \n \nThe player takes on the role of a new male Disciple whose name may be entered manually or chosen at random. On the day he arrives at the Academy, he meets with two other newcomers, Fuuko and Chlotz, whom he saves from a stray monster. Once at the Academy, they are to be assigned a rank, to know if they are standard Disciples or elite, and have their Ether count measured. All three are found to be elites, Fuuko is even an S rank, the highest possible rank. The protagonist is only A rank, but his Ether count is off the charts. That high amount of Ether (tens of times the average) makes him a special Disciple called God's Gift. This will enable him to create an Ether field which allows him to enter the Dusk Circles and make it possible for other Disciples to accompany him and use Star Energy inside. \n \nLike its predecessor, Conception II is divided in two parts: the city and academy, and the dungeons. The player moves to the different areas in the city by choosing them on a list. Each area as its own purpose: the dorm is where the player edits the party and manages the save data, the church is where new units are created, and the Academy is where most events occur. To create Star Children, the hero must perform a ritual known as classmating with one of the seven heroines. Classmating requires BP, which is gained in bonding events and by meeting certain conditions in battle. As the hero's Ether and an heroine's Star Energy are combined inside a device called a Matryoshka womb (Matryoshka with various effects are acquired as the game progresses), Star Children of various classes are born. Each Star Child is either male or female and has his or her own abilities. The strength and maximum level of a Star Child is influenced by the bond (mood and intimacy) the hero has with the selected heroine. That bond, displayed by a smiley icon that looks happier or angrier depending on the girl's current mood, changes through events in the Academy, in which the player chooses different dialogues that will influence his relationship with the girls. Some of these events make use of the touch screen. Only three bonding events can be played at a time, but the numbers of remaining events, shown by three hearts on the top left corner, is refilled when time passes by exploring a labyrinth or resting in the dorm. The story normally progresses only when the corresponding icon is selected at the Academy, but some events may be required for this icon to be available. \n \nIn the dungeons, the player explores a randomized labyrinth with a party of up to four units: the hero and one of the heroines form the main unit, and three groups of three Star Children may accompany them. The enemies are displayed by icons that change depending on the foe's strength; the weakest enemies can be defeated without fighting. In battle, the units act in turn and are placed either in front, behind or on one of the sides of an enemy. Each enemy has a weak spot, a direction from which more damage is dealt. Attacking from dangerous spots (they have the word \"Caution\" identifying them when the enemy is about to perform a strong attack) fills the chain gauge; when the gauge fills enough, the monster's turn gets delayed. Another aspect of battles is the Ether level: depending what actions are performed, this level will rise or lower. Higher Ether means that the party will be stronger. Once a labyrinth is cleared, a more difficult version can be access from the training station, and quests such as defeating certain monsters or finding a specific item can be taken at the lab to be completed by revisiting the dungeons. \n \nAs with many dating simulation games, Conception II has multiple endings depending on the different relationships developed throughout the game.",

Eight such circles forming the Pandora Labyrinth are known to exist: the original one, which is still inactive, and one for each of the seven deadly sins. The Disciples formed at the Academy are the first line of defense against the monsters, but they cannot enter the labyrinth since the energy inside nullifies their Star Power. \n \nThe player takes on the role of a new male Disciple whose name may be entered manually or chosen at random. On the day he arrives at the Academy, he meets with two other newcomers, Fuuko and Chlotz, whom he saves from a stray monster. Once at the Academy, they are to be assigned a rank, to know if they are standard Disciples or elite, and have their Ether count measured. All three are found to be elites, Fuuko is even an S rank, the highest possible rank. The protagonist is only A rank, but his Ether count is off the charts. That high amount of Ether (tens of times the average) makes him a special Disciple called God's Gift. This will enable him to create an Ether field which allows him to enter the Dusk Circles and make it possible for other Disciples to accompany him and use Star Energy inside. \n \nLike its predecessor, Conception II is divided in two parts: the city and academy, and the dungeons. The player moves to the different areas in the city by choosing them on a list. Each area as its own purpose: the dorm is where the player edits the party and manages the save data, the church is where new units are created, and the Academy is where most events occur. To create Star Children, the hero must perform a ritual known as classmating with one of the seven heroines. Classmating requires BP, which is gained in bonding events and by meeting certain conditions in battle. As the hero's Ether and an heroine's Star Energy are combined inside a device called a Matryoshka womb (Matryoshka with various effects are acquired as the game progresses), Star Children of various classes are born. Each Star Child is either male or female and has his or her own abilities. The strength and maximum level of a Star Child is influenced by the bond (mood and intimacy) the hero has with the selected heroine. That bond, displayed by a smiley icon that looks happier or angrier depending on the girl's current mood, changes through events in the Academy, in which the player chooses different dialogues that will influence his relationship with the girls. Some of these events make use of the touch screen. Only three bonding events can be played at a time, but the numbers of remaining events, shown by three hearts on the top left corner, is refilled when time passes by exploring a labyrinth or resting in the dorm. The story normally progresses only when the corresponding icon is selected at the Academy, but some events may be required for this icon to be available. \n \nIn the dungeons, the player explores a randomized labyrinth with a party of up to four units: the hero and one of the heroines form the main unit, and three groups of three Star Children may accompany them. The enemies are displayed by icons that change depending on the foe's strength; the weakest enemies can be defeated without fighting. In battle, the units act in turn and are placed either in front, behind or on one of the sides of an enemy. Each enemy has a weak spot, a direction from which more damage is dealt. Attacking from dangerous spots (they have the word \"Caution\" identifying them when the enemy is about to perform a strong attack) fills the chain gauge; when the gauge fills enough, the monster's turn gets delayed. Another aspect of battles is the Ether level: depending what actions are performed, this level will rise or lower. Higher Ether means that the party will be stronger. Once a labyrinth is cleared, a more difficult version can be access from the training station, and quests such as defeating certain monsters or finding a specific item can be taken at the lab to be completed by revisiting the dungeons. \n \nAs with many dating simulation games, Conception II has multiple endings depending on the different relationships developed throughout the game.",

To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called \"Sachiko Ever After\", which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. \n \nThis does not go as expected. \n \nFollowing an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary School, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of survival - much less escape - is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them.",

Card types range from monster cards (e.g. Skeleton), which are used to accumulate territory on the board to increase your mana; Equipment (e.g. Chain Mail), which will boost your monsters' abilities when they battle; and Magic (e.g. Holy Word 0), which can be used to help you or hinder the other players on the board. When a player lands on another player's monster, he/she can challenge it to a battle in an attempt to take over the territory. If the attacker wins, he/she gets the space on the board and additional mana. \n \nThere are more than sixteen different game boards, each with different rules and layouts (such as the maximum number on dice rolls, the elements on the board, etc.)",

It was released in Japan for the Nintendo 3DS handheld gaming console on February 28, 2013. Its sequel, Dragon Ball Heroes: Ultimate Mission 2, was released in 2014. \n \nThe game recreates the interface of the Dragon Ball Heroes arcade game via the touch panel. The player assembles a deck of five cards for battles. As the player uses the touch stylus to create a card formation on the bottom screen, the battle unfolds on the top screen. Actions, such as the Charge Impact, are done so that the player can intuitively do them with their hands on the portable device. \n \nThe game includes a scouter function, which uses the 3DS' camera to take a picture of someone's face in order to check their power. This allows the player to earn Zeni and other items. Scan someone with a high power level and Great Ape Vegeta will appear as a boss fight, and tag up with friends to take him on. Scanning special QR codes allows the player to fight special bosses, such as Beerus or Super Saiyan God Goku from the 2013 movie Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods. \n \nIn the story mode, the player moves around what is called the Ultimate Map and experiences the story from the Saiyan Saga up through Dragon Ball GT, with the most famous scenes from the series recreated for the game. By completing missions, more cards are obtained in the game.",

Other novelties are the option to change the gender and re-fight bosses for an additional chance to get a better drop. Money can now be exchanged for experience to level up. During character creation three additional races are available. It also allows for custom avatars and offers the ability to re-colour the character appearance and costumes.

Virtual money won in puzzle levels is spent on renovating the farm. Exactly like in Gardenscapes, there are always three kinds of an object (for example shed, dog kennel, lanterns, gazebo...) to choose from and after four objects are bought, the next four appear. However, virtual money is won through match-3 levels, like in Fishdom. The game also contains hidden object levels, but they don't yield money and are rather used to push the story forward. Another kind of gameplay found are short object puzzles in the farm view itself, similar to point-and-click games. The game also has its system of achievements, related both to storyline and to puzzle gameplay. All achievements can be viewed as trophies in farmer Joe's house.",

        "desc": "A youth has grown up as one of the royal children of the glory-seeking nation of Nohr. Though their father has forbidden them to leave the castle, they still live a happy life with their four siblings. However, when they finally are sent to the outside world, it is on a mission to Hoshido, a peace-loving country that Nohr has plans to invade. There they learn that they were born to the Hoshido royal family, and were kidnapped by Nohr as an infant. A Nohr princess named Azura was taken hostage by Hoshido in retaliation, and has been living in a similar situation to the protagonist. With war looming on the horizon, Azura and the protagonist choose to side with their family in Hoshido, and defend it against the invading Nohr forces. \n \nBirthright is one of three versions of Fire Emblem Fates, the others being Conquest and Revelation. In this version, the player controls their fully customizable avatar as they lead Hoshido's forces in strategic battles against Nohr-allied enemies. Gameplay is similar to Fire Emblem Awakening, with less challenging gameplay and the opportunity to grind for money, items, and experience in between storyline battles. In addition to the Classic and Casual modes featured in Awakening, this game contains Phoenix Mode, in which defeated allies are immediately resurrected on the following turn. Players pick one of these three modes at the start of the game, but may choose to permanently switch from Classic or Casual to a less difficult mode later on. \n \nSupports also return from Awakening, allowing characters to build their relationships as they fight alongside each other. Two characters of the opposite sex may get married and have children once their relationship has progressed enough, and Birthright also includes the possibility of a same-sex relationship if the player chooses the female protagonist. \n \nA feature called My Castle allows the player to build and customize a village that can contain various helpful buildings, such as shops that sell weapons or healing items. The village can be upgraded with resources collected through StreetPass, and it is also where StreetPass battles are held. Winning a StreetPass battle allows the player to recruit one of the defeated opponent units into their own army, and a shop in the village allows players to purchase other special units called Einherjard. \n \nPlayers may purchase DLC that allows them to play through the Conquest and Revelation scenarios as well.",

Arino has been sent back to the 1980s and has lost his memory, remembering only his love of classic video games. The only way to recover and return to his own time is by playing video games and completing challenges. And of course, you're there to help him a little -- or in other words, play everything for him while he sits and comments on how you're playing. \n \nThe story mode is broken into chapters -- one for each featured game -- where the player can wander around the small town and speak with various characters, who are all based on and voiced by cast or guests from the TV show. Each of the featured games is a brand new \"faux-retro\" game made to look like an old 8- or 16-bit video game, from a wide variety of genres including maze games, platformers, shooters, and even a full-fledged RPG. There are also a number of side games including Game & Watch-style LCD games, marble labyrinth games, and even the 10-yen medal games commonly featured on the show's arcade trip segments, for a total of over 15 games. \n \nIn addition to the story mode, there is also a free mode where any unlocked game can be freely played, an ad-hod multiplayer mode for the games that support it, and a dictionary mode where famous quotes and terms from the TV show are explained.",

Dual Destinies features the return of series protagonist Phoenix Wright as a practicing lawyer and playable character, having regained his attorney's badge after the events of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. Apollo Justice also returns in this installment as a playable character. The men are joined at the agency by Athena Cykes, a rookie lawyer with a personal connection to a few of the cases in the game. \n \nLike previous games in the series, gameplay in Dual Destinies is broken up into two distinct segments: investigation and trial. In the investigation phase, the player navigates through a series of screens, searching for clues and interviewing witnesses. Items and other pertinent information found are added to the court record for use during the trial phase. In the trial phase, witnesses take the stand, and the player is given the opportunity to present evidence that contradicts their testimony. Dual Destinies also features the return of two additional gameplay mechanics introduced earlier in the series: the \"Psyche-Lock,\" where witnesses during the investigation phase refuse to divulge information, forcing the player to present evidence to get them to talk; and the \"Perceive System\" in the trial phase, where the player looks for non-verbal tells that a witness is hiding something. The addition of Athena as a playable character introduces the \"Mood Matrix,\" where Athena is capable of scanning the emotions of a witness to locate the parts of their testimony that cause them the most distress or where their mood contradicts what they're saying. \n \nDual Destinies features five cases, with the three protagonists trading off lead defense responsibilities while the other attorneys act as assistants and guides. Players face off against a new prosecutor character, Simon Blackquill, as well as returning series regular Miles Edgeworth. Like previous Ace Attorney installments, the order of the cases is not in strict chronological order, with the first case actually taking place timeline-wise in the middle of the fourth case, serving as a tutorial to ease new players into the gameplay. \n \nUnlike its predecessors, Dual Destinies did not receive a physical release in Western territories. Two DLC cases were also released, \"Turnabout Reclaimed\" and \"Quiz Turnabout Deduction.\" Only the former has been made available outside of Japan.",

There are two ways to shape your squad: first, you could thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to join from an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers. Think of them as brochures for new players, complete with stats and sign-up requirements. As you play more and more, you can potentially meet over a thousand players, but you only get 16 slots for your team, and just 110 for the entire roster, so pick carefully! \n \nWhen the time comes to kick off, youll find two match types. The first one is an 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise, five-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job, like scoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch, then tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so you can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to plan your play - dodge or tackle. \n \nSpecial Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six, super-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or whenever certain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting Spirits, which increase players statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to help you get the edge over the opposing team. \n \nWhen youre not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out, and talk to people to get the lowdown on school life. Later on, youll be able to go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the Shopping Area or the Royal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too! \n \nSaving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth Sector is only part of the package, as theres a stack of other challenges to tackle. Test your skills against up to three friends in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players during Story Mode.

Her friends and family have been frozen inside mysterious black crystals, and all of the beautiful buildings and castles are in shambles. Only by finding and planting the seeds of magical plants can she find out what happened to everyone and attempt to restore the city. \n \nJewel Match 3 is the first in the series to incorporate a full story. It features many elements from its predecessors, but also has improved graphics and dynamic visual effects and sounds. \n \nAfter the introduction, choose the type of game to play from three selections. Normal (timed) and Relaxed (untimed) are built around the adventure storyline, while Match3 Maniac skips the story and lets players dive right into \"match 3\" timed levels. \n \nIn all games there are several objectives. All of the tiles with a gold background must be cleared, and all of the magical items must be collected. Obstacles include tiles with chains, wood, and silver \"unpolished\" surfaces, some of which must be matched two or more times. Most levels consist of multiple rooms as well, and all of those rooms must be completed. Collect a red key, for instance, to unlock an area in a different room locked with red blocks. Some magical items and keys are hidden underneath other tiles. \n \nTools to help with tile matching and removal come in the form of eight magical spells which are introduced gradually and have three strengths.  To use the spells, fill Luna's mana bar by collecting green bottles from the puzzle levels. The destructive hammer, like in other Jewel Match games, also has three power levels. Match four or more tiles to receive a multi-color flower tile which matches any of the jewels. Matching five or more gains a gold arrow-shaped \"helix\" row blaster. \n \nThe adventure games (Normal and Relaxed) have features in addition to an evolving story. There are hidden object and jigsaw puzzle mini-games, a shop where in-game coins can be spent, and the rebuilding of castles which can be saved as desktop wallpapers when completed. \n \nThe game has 100 levels. It is possible to finish an adventure game in less than that number. If that happens, the player is given bonus levels so that all 100 can be played.",

This time around, Kirby is defending Popstar from the corrupt Haltmann Works Company, which aims to mechanize the planet and steal its natural resources. The new gameplay mechanic introduced in this title is Robobot Armor, a mech suit with copy abilities similar to Kirby's own. The Robobot Armor is much more powerful than Kirby and can interact with obstacles that he may not be able to pass on his own, but its large size sometimes means Kirby will need to exit the suit and proceed on foot. In addition to the mech gameplay, Kirby has access to three copy abilities that are new to the series: Doctor, Poison, and ESP. All copy abilities can be accessed at will by scanning in compatible amiibos, including alternate costumes that can only be obtained through figures made specifically for this game. \n \nAlternate modes include Team Kirby Clash, an action RPG that supports up to 4 players; Kirby 3D Rumble, in which Kirby moves around an arena to defeat enemies as fast as possible while aiming for a high score; Meta Knightmare Returns, a speed-oriented mode in which the player controls Meta Knight through modified versions of the levels from story mode; and the Arena and True Arena modes that return from other platformers in the series.",

        "name": "Kokuga (Japan)",
        "desc": "Kokuga is a slow-moving, free-scrolling top-down shooter where players are placed in control of a futuristic \"compact mobile tank\" known as Kokuga.  The Kokuga is suspended on four \"legs\" and features a single turret capable of rotating 360 degrees using the shoulder buttons.   \n \nEach stage has the player move through destroying other mechanical, tank-like, turret-like, and robotic enemies.  Most stages end with massive and varied boss battles.  Stages are separated into segments with large gates at the dividers--destroying all enemies before destroying the divider resorts in bonus shield repairs.  Destroying the gate without defeating all the enemies in that section merely results in all enemies therein being annihilated.   \n \nKokuga differentiates itself from most other shooters in a variety of ways.  Rather than collecting power-ups, players already have 20 \"cards\" to utilize.  Of these 20 attack and support cards, four are randomly displayed on the touch-screen at a time and offer a variety of abilities, from an offensive laser ring around the player, to homing shots, to shield restoration and damage repairs.  Players cannot cycle through the cards, and in order to get new ones, at least one current card must be used.  In this way, the game offers an unusual strategy element to the shooter gameplay--careful and planned use of power-up cards over simply powering up as much as possible as soon as possible. \n \nAlso different is the level set-up.  There are three \"final\" stages at the corners of a triangular grid which make up the final stages.  The stages themselves are laid out somewhat like a keyboard labeled with letters A~L, and a player may start at any stage.  However, continuing through the game requires a player to select an adjacent stage from the completed first.  \n \nA final \"game ending\" stage can only be played once an adjacent stage has been completed. In this way, players may play for as long or as short as they wish.  With games encompassing several stages, or just a couple.  This longer game option even allows players to replay a completed stage--but it will automatically be at a higher difficulty.  In this way, a player's game could be as short as two stages (a regular and a final) or as long as 37 (all regular three times, and one final). \n \nIn a vain similar to the dark, nigh-genocidal story behind titles like Ikaruga, the story here is a bleak melodrama focused on ethnic rivalries and the incomprehensible nature of humans.  The similarity is likely due to the game sharing the same director (Hiroshi Iuchi) as Ikaruga.  No actual countries are named, rather, they are listed by letters with \"Country A\" and \"Country I.\"  The story is played out in largely text-based cut-scenes with dark background imagery.  The text itself carries a militaristic flavor to it, further adding to the melodrama of the story.",

Use your combat skills as a Spinjitsu Master to artistic effect, as you thump, jump and hoof your way through a solid slew of robotic goons.

As luck would have it, youve got some cracking secret weapons like Technoblades, as well as sweet rides for vehicular supremacy - fancy a spin in Coles Earth Mech or Zanes Ninjacopter? \n \nAs you bash your way through the city, youll sneak into the ominous Borg Tower and take on Tech Wu. But as well as flexing your muscles, youd better have acute mental power to solve puzzles, hack computers and beat minigames. Take control of different characters for certain sections, helping you mix up your technique, before dropping you into the Digiverse for the ultimate showdown! \n \nWhen youre done for the day, why not chill at the Hub in New Ninjago City?

        "desc": "After the happenings of Luigi's Mansion, Luigi once again has to put on his ghostbusting gear. This time he visits Evershade Valley, where the destruction of the Dark Moon caused all ghosts to become hostile to humans. Luigi is hired by the eccentric professor Gadd to visit five haunted mansions to retrieve the Dark Moon parts. \n \nLuigi's weapon of choice is vacuum device called PolterGust 5000 which is used to fight against the numerous ghost enemies. The basic procedure is always the same: Luigi has to stun the ghosts with the flashlight (in contrast to the predecessor, now the position and angle is important) so he can vacuum them in. Of course the ghosts struggle against it, so their movement has to be countered with the analogue stick. There are different kinds of enemies which require a variation of tactics, e.g. some ghosts have sunglasses which have to be removed first and others are only vulnerable briefly. There are also multi-stage bossfights.  \n \nThe PolterGust 5000 is also used to solve puzzles, for example by sucking in a stove and using the flames to ignite something else. It is also a good idea to use the vacuum device on physical objects in the mansions in order to find secret passages or treasure. When Luigi picks up enough treasure, the PolterGust 5000 is automatically upgraded. \n \nBesides the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode which takes place in the ScareScraper, mansion with 25 floors. The available modes are hunter (sucking in as many ghosts as possible in a limited amount of time), rush (finding the exit in a limited amount of time; clocks can be picked up to extend the time limit) and polterpup (tracking down polterpulps, invisible ghosts, with the flashlight).",

This time he visits Evershade Valley, where the destruction of the Dark Moon caused all ghosts to become hostile to humans. Luigi is hired by the eccentric professor Gadd to visit five haunted mansions to retrieve the Dark Moon parts. \n \nLuigi's weapon of choice is vacuum device called PolterGust 5000 which is used to fight against the numerous ghost enemies. The basic procedure is always the same: Luigi has to stun the ghosts with the flashlight (in contrast to the predecessor, now the position and angle is important) so he can vacuum them in. Of course the ghosts struggle against it, so their movement has to be countered with the analogue stick. There are different kinds of enemies which require a variation of tactics, e.g. some ghosts have sunglasses which have to be removed first and others are only vulnerable briefly. There are also multi-stage bossfights.  \n \nThe PolterGust 5000 is also used to solve puzzles, for example by sucking in a stove and using the flames to ignite something else. It is also a good idea to use the vacuum device on physical objects in the mansions in order to find secret passages or treasure. When Luigi picks up enough treasure, the PolterGust 5000 is automatically upgraded. \n \nBesides the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode which takes place in the ScareScraper, mansion with 25 floors. The available modes are hunter (sucking in as many ghosts as possible in a limited amount of time), rush (finding the exit in a limited amount of time; clocks can be picked up to extend the time limit) and polterpup (tracking down polterpulps, invisible ghosts, with the flashlight).",

        "desc": "In Luxor, you journey through Egypt while battling Set to help Isis save the land. \n \nA level in Luxor consists of a pyramid and a long path. On this path, scarabs, Set's minions, are moving long groups of different colored spheres toward the pyramid. Your mission is to hinder those scarabs from completing their task. For this purpose, you have a winged sphere shooter with which you fire your own spheres into the queues of the moving scarabs. \n \nWhen you create a group of 3 spheres of the same color, they vanish. As soon as all spheres of a scarab are removed, you have destroyed this minion. Either when you destroy one of Set's minions, or you take too long to destroy it, another minion with lots of new spheres enters the screen, heading for the pyramid. Once you have destroyed all spheres in a level, you proceed to the next one. But when a scarab's spheres reach into the pyramid, you have lost a life. \n \nThe game offers 88 levels, which are spread over 12 stages throughout ancient Egypt. When you progress through the levels, you will start with just one pyramid, but this will change over time, and you must play against two (or even more) scarab groups simultaneously. \n \nTo help you, and make the game more interesting, there are plenty of power-ups available, like fireballs and lightning bolts for destroying multiple spheres, stopping, slowing down, and reversing the movement of all enemy scarabs for a few seconds, precision shots (with an aiming help), and some others.",

        "desc": "Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars is a 2D puzzle game starring Mario and Donkey Kong. The monkey still likes to kidnap and the player has to complete levels helping Minis, wind-up toy versions of Mario and other characters, while solving puzzles. They walk by themselves and need to be guided to an exit. The player interferes by using touch on the GamePad to manipulate the environment. This is done by leading enemies away, covering traps, building or removing girders and adding or removing springs. Some levels have a character that needs to be freed and guided to safety. Other elements are escalators, conveyors with different directions, free-form building blocks, spikes to avoid, hammers to defeat Donkey Kongs blocking paths, toy Donkey Kongs with cannons heads, cursed Minis that need to be reclaimed etc. Levels are grouped per eight and each group introduces a new mechanic before mixing them up. It no longer uses Pipe Dream-like mechanic from the previous title Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move. \n \nAll levels are played in a small environments. Many only have a limited amount of objects to help the characters and in some cases additional elements need to be picked up in the environment before they can be used. This also requires removing items when the characters have passed a section. Along the way small coins and a large 'M' coin can be collected for additional points or an additional challenge. The characters need to reach the exit together and cannot be left behind. Up to three stars can be earned by completing a level. \n \nThe game includes a level editor. In the workshop players can design custom levels and share them through the Miiverse. Sharing levels is rewarded with stars. They are also earned by playing custom levels, having your levels played, and players can tip each other's creations with stars, which the title references. Levels can only be shared if the original creator can fully complete the level collecting all coins and not losing any Minis. Stars unlock new elements for the level editor and open up bonus levels. \n \nIt is the first Cross-Buy across the two systems (through an additional download code) and there are only a few differences. On the 3DS the game is controlled through touch and displayed on the bottom screen. There is no 3D support. The top screen shows the same, but in a smaller box, along with the score, remaining items and the remaining time. Through SpotPass and StreetPass players can send and receive custom levels regardless of the platform they are created from or played on. Stars and progress are not carried over across platforms.",

There are the usual jobs in the genre, like warriors, clerics, mages, besides more unusual ones, like cats.

A supporting cast of ten 'assist' characters, three of which can be taken along per chapter, offers a different dynamic to gameplay, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat. \n \nNaruto fans will be able to engage in a bespoke storyline based on the last events of the manga and animation series, featuring an all new female ninja character, Malice. The mysterious Five Kages, will also make their first videogame appearance in an adventure which spans nine different locations, with secret items and stages aplenty to be unlocked along the way. \n \nNaruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era on 3DS also incorporates the lead character's 'Sage Mode', in which Naruto transforms into a significantly more powerful version of himself once his special gauge is charged to maximum. The game will make use of the 3DS' motion controls, in situations such as avoiding certain attacks and during boss fights.",

A supporting cast of ten 'assist' characters, three of which can be taken along per chapter, offers a different dynamic to gameplay, allowing for a more strategic approach to combat. \n \nNaruto fans will be able to engage in a bespoke storyline based on the last events of the manga and animation series, featuring an all new female ninja character, Malice. The mysterious Five Kages, will also make their first videogame appearance in an adventure which spans nine different locations, with secret items and stages aplenty to be unlocked along the way. \n \nNaruto Shippuden 3D: The New Era on 3DS also incorporates the lead character's 'Sage Mode', in which Naruto transforms into a significantly more powerful version of himself once his special gauge is charged to maximum.

The turtles eventually stop this treat, but a sudden call gets them on edge again. April O'Neil has been kidnapped by Shredder and he demands Splinter. The turtles fight their way through Foot Soldiers, Kraang, Baxter Stockman and his Mousers to be able to defeat Shredder and save April. \n \nJust like the original games it is a brawler game, but now in 3D. Many sequences use the classic side view, but there are also many other perspectives used. Each turtle has a specific attack and the four turtles are always on the screen. When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items. The collectibles in this game are Mutagen Canisters which are used to unlock extras.",

The turtles eventually stop this treat, but a sudden call gets them on edge again. April O'Neil has been kidnapped by Shredder and he demands Splinter. The turtles fight their way through Foot Soldiers, Kraang, Baxter Stockman and his Mousers to be able to defeat Shredder and save April. \n \nJust like the original games it is a brawler game, but now in 3D. Many sequences use the classic side view, but there are also many other perspectives used. Each turtle has a specific attack and the four turtles are always on the screen. When not playing in co-op, the other ones are controller by the AI. During the game the turtles have to be upgraded. This can be done by collecting points by defeating enemies and breaking items. Health of any of the turtles is increased by eating pizza's, sushi and other food items. The collectibles in this game are Mutagen Canisters which are used to unlock extras.",

        "desc": "Professor Layton and Luke head to the town of miracles, Montdol, in search of the Mask of Miracle. The mask has the ability to grant wishes to its wearer. Layton and Luke arrive at the town to see they are too late, as a mysterious man is using the power of the mask to turn people to stone. Layton and Luke task themselves with solving the mystery of Montdol and the Mask of Miracles. \n \nThis fifth game in the Professor Layton series makes more use of the physical button controls for puzzle-solving as opposed to just the touchscreen. To take advantage of the hardware capabilities of the Nintendo 3DS, the characters are rendered in polygons outside of cutscenes, as opposed to sprites, in addition to other polishings of the interface. \n \nBeside the regular adventure where you traverse the town, talk to the characters and solve puzzles, there are several mini-games that get gradually unlocked as you play and find the unlockable items: \n \n Bunny - after a while, you will stumble upon a circus bunny that isn't performing well and decide to help it along. This will require constant training of new moves which will become available over time as you acquire them. After you teach the bunny new moves, you will be able to instruct it to use those moves during the theatrical performances. Theatrical performances consist of a director telling you what the story is about and what he wants to see in each scene, and you will have to instruct bunny to act accordingly, providing you have taught it the moves necessary to perform the full play. \n Robot - after you acquire a toy robot from one of the street vendors, you will be able to play levels that will become gradually available.

Why? As it turns out, she's the so-called \"Great Hero\" of this particular world. But there's no time for dilly-dallying...

Battles are fought in a variation of standard Puyo Puyo fashion: attack enemies by making chains, while at the same time trying to alternately conserve health and avoid getting swamped in Nuisance Puyo! Winning battles gains experience and levels up the party, which makes characters stronger. In addition, a series of side quests can be completed, with wonderful rewards awaiting at the end. \n \nOf course, it wouldn't be a Puyo Puyo game without the Battle Mode, where up to 4 players face each other in a fight to the last.",

        "desc": "Taking place in 2005, between the events of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, the action centers on BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) member Jill Valentine and introduces her new partner, Parker Luciani. The story is set principally on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship in the Mediterranean, where Jill and Parker have been sent to search for Chris Redfield, based on his last known GPS coordinates. Far from being empty, the ship hides danger around every corner as Jill and Parker explore the confined space of the ship and must face a menacing new horror that emerges from the darkness. \n  \nAdding a new unique horror setting to the series, Resident Evil: Revelations gives players the chance to venture underwater as they try to escape the terrifying creatures that are roaming the ship. But even the water does not provide safety as the creatures continue to attack from the depths while Jill and Parker make a desperate bid to make it off the ship alive.",

The Mercenaries 3D is essentially a full game version of the now classic Mercenaries mode found in Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5. \n \nGameplay \n \nThe Mercenaries 3 plays almost exactly like the Mercenaries modes of it's console brethren.  It is an action-oriented title where players can choose any of eight playable characters to shoot, explode, and melee their way through swarms of marauding enemies.  The game is viewed from the over-the-shoulder style of Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, switching to a zoomed view when targeting enemies.  The zoomed view can be played in either third or first-person.   \n \nThe gameplay is straightforward and simple:  Kill as many enemies as possible within a time limit, or kill a required number of enemies before time runs out.  Stages have individual settings, such as all being done in a set time limit, having a time limit that can be extended, defeating waves of enemies, or defeating a boss character.  All enemies and stages are taken from and inspired by  Resident Evil 4 and 5.  There are thirty individual missions in all. \n \nFeatures \n \nThe game features a variety of features to add some depth to the original experience.  Most notable is the wide variety of Skills that can be applied to each character and upgraded.  Each character can carry up to three different skills at one time, and they gain experience and improve as the game is played with them equipped.  Skills such as being resistant to death, reloading guns faster, better use of medical supplies, and the like are peppered throughout the game.  These are unlocked by playing through the regular game and accomplishing various tasks, such as building combos with kills. \n \nThere are also a wide variety of medals that can be earned through the game for completing various tasks.  There are fifty medals that can be earned which range from simple \"Clear all Missions for Level 1\" to more challenge-focused elements like \"Kill 3 enemies with 1 hand grenade\" or \"Clear a mission without ever missing a shot.\" \n \nThere is a level of weapon customization and there are alternate costumes for all the usable characters as well.  Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D is also playable in co-op both online and in local play. \n \nResident Evil: Revelations \n \nArguably the biggest added feature to the game is that is comes with a playable demo of the next main-line game for the Resident Evil series, which is called Resident Evil: Revelations and is geared towards the classic survival horror style of the franchise.  The demo is brief, but intended to give players an idea that Capcom is interested in successfully combining the survival horror aspects of the original games with the refined gameplay from modern titles.

Advancing through the plot may involve solving puzzles or, more frequently, completing a mini-game where Raphael must move to the beat.

However, there is a secret curriculum at this school, sponsored by the national government, to train promising young candidates in shinobido -- the way of the ninja. Of the more than 1000 students at the academy, five cute young girls have been selected for this program to become agents of justice for their country. But not all ninja work for just and righteous masters, and their struggle against evil -- not to mention with everyday teenage life -- has only just begun. \n \nSenran Kagura is an action beat-'em-up game starring a team of ninja-in-training high school girls. The story is broken up into missions, which generally involve beating up on waves of enemy ninja in classic side-scrolling fashion, with various other objectives depending on the stage. It is possible to switch between the five members of the team between missions; however, some missions can only be tackled with specific characters. \n \nEach girl has their own unique sets of combos and attacks, earns experience and levels up separately, and can be dressed up in numerous unlockable outfits. Outfits take damage and can be destroyed in battle, which affects the character's abilities; there is even a special \"inochigake\" (\"life on the line\") state where the character rips off their own clothing, granting them a boost in attack power for a short time, and giving additional bonuses if a mission is cleared in this state.",

It plays much like a combination of the earlier SoniComi and Namco's The Idolmaster. The player takes the role of a young producer at a talent agency who has been tasked with developing Sonico's talents, image, and career. While she may be a beautiful young girl with a great singing voice and skill with a guitar, she is still inexperienced, rather naive, and lacking in confidence, and as such needs proper guidance to become a real star. \n \nThe game is broken up into three distinct sections. The bulk of the game is spent in conversation mode, where the player speaks with Sonico and the other characters, as well as plans her schedule and events. Quite often there are dialogue choices which will influence Sonico's progress and character, which in turn leads to different types of job requests. There are also two types of events; Live Events and Gravure Events. Live Events are a live performance of a song, which plays out like a simple rhythm game, while Gravure Events involve taking photos of Sonico in different outfits, and giving her instructions on how to pose. Performance in each of these sections also determines Sonico's popularity and influences her career. \n \nThere are also Free Live and Free Gravure modes available, where the player can simply enjoy the unlocked content for fun without without worrying about specific requests or career progress.",

Take care of a special teddy bear who can talk, walk and play games in a title thats ideal for parents and children to play together. Who hasnt dreamed of their favourite toy coming to life? \n \nAfter being delivered to your house, along with a mysterious key, Teddy springs to life and starts to talk! You can give Teddy a name and enter your own to start your newfound friendship. The tale of Teddy Together advances a bit each day as you learn more about the teddys purpose and the mysterious key. \n \nThis curious little bear is particularly interested in learning more about friendship, and often asks questions like, What do you do for fun?, How do you make friends?, and Whats your favourite food? Teddy will remember your answers and talk to you about them later on, forming a unique relationship between you and Teddy, as the answers are always just between you two. You can also introduce Teddy to your friends and family by handing them your Nintendo 3DS family system. Your friends and family can give answers that Teddy will remember and even mention later on. \n \nTeddy loves to eat too, and you can play fun minigames via the Touch Screen to prepare a range of meals to feed Teddy. If the food is too hot, youll have to blow into the microphone to cool it down! Teddy can be a bit of a messy eater at times, so a little light cleaning might be needed after a meal. Teddy also loves to take baths! \n \nYou can dress Teddy up with a big range of tops, hats, shoes, accessories and more, plus different fur colours to unlock too, making each players bear even more unique to them. You can get clothes, special lollies that unlock new fur colours and seeds that can be planted in the garden using in-game coins, which are earned through playing or by tapping a compatible amiibo (sold separately) once per day. \n \nMake friends with a teddy bear that comes to life and help them learn more about friendship in Teddy Together, only on Nintendo 3DS family systems!",

Power-ups are gained by clearing lines that have symbols. \n \nEndless lets you play up to level 30, with a faster speed for each new level. \n \nMarathon is the classic mode where you need to clear a number of lines to reach a new level with faster speed, with fifteen levels in total. \n \nSprint is about clearing 40 lines as quickly as possible. \n \nUltra provides three minutes to achieve a high score.Not all game modes are available right away. Endless for instance is only unlocked after completing Marathon. Multiplayer is supported both offline and online, for up to four players and game types such as Marathon or Endless. Players can also work together or co-op or in a team to clear lines on a grid that is larger than the standard one. There is a leveling system with belts based on the player's performance, also used for online matchmaking. The core gameplay remains unchanged. Pieces can be moved left and right, drop quickly, or are rotated. The next piece is shown and it also possible to hold on to one to use it at a later time. The game includes an in-game store for additional content and generates a Tetris Self diagram, an AI-controlled version of your playing style and performance friends can play against when you are offline. By enabling Tetris Live you open up your games for other players to join. Game options include enabling hold pieces, using the 7-bag or the classic selection for tetrominoes, toggling wall kicks and T-spins, and altering the time it takes for a piece to lock into place on the grid. \n \nThe 3DS version is largely identical to the other platforms in content, but there are some differences. Exclusive to the 3DS version are four challenge modes: \nEscalation: similar to Marathon or Endless, but each new level requires more lines to complete. \nInvisible: tetroninmoes become invisible when they are locked on the grid. \nMaster: regular gameplay, but tetronimoes do not appear at the top, instead they appear instantly at the bottom. \nRotation Lock: you cannot rotate tetronimoes.The later PS Vita release has three additional game modes: Haunted, Landslide and Time's Up.",

As the U.S. prepares to launch the USS Clarence E. Walsh, Third Echelon sends the famous Sam Fisher on a mission that appears to be unrelated to the incident, but which may end up being the most important element of it all. \n \nIn Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, players take on the role of field operative Sam Fisher for a third outing. Fisher has some new moves this time around, and he also has a new weapon always at his disposal; a combat knife. Utilizing the knife, Sam can either kill his enemies, or simply knock them out. At the end of each mission, the player is given an overview of how they did. The more people that the player spares, the better the success score. \n \nThe single-player game is more open-ended than the past two Splinter Cell games. While players are still forced through some areas in a \"tunnel\" like fashion, with no choice of where to go, there are many instances where they can decide how they'd like to get there. For example, in the caverns, one can either kill two enemies and cross the bridge, or leave them alone, sneak along the side path, and climb a ladder at the end, bypassing the fight entirely, but still winding up in the same location. \n \nThroughout the game many different locations are visited, such as a lighthouse, a Japanese tea house, Seoul, New York City during an East Coast blackout, and other such exotic locales. \n \nThe Spies-vs-Mercs multiplayer mode that appeared in the previous game has returned, with some new features. There are several new, large maps to play on, as well as updated versions from the past game. The PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox versions feature this mode.",

        "desc": "Wipeout 2 is a game based on the \"game show\" of the same name on major television network ABC in the United States.  In it, the game is organized as if players are taking place in numerous events over the course of an \"episode,\" as if it's part of a television episode.  Each event is preceded with an introduction by in-game characters of the hosts of the show (John Henderson and John Anderson), and just before beginning the event, a mock interview with hostess Jill Wagner.   \n \nEvents are organized in four rounds as such:  A Qualifier round, an Elimination Round, a Final Four round, and the final Wipeout Zone.  Some rounds are played with players taking turns, and some are played simultaneously (when in two-player mode).  Players are simply competing to complete the ridiculously set-up stages with the fastest times.  Episodes are split into Summer or Winter events, and there are four episodes per season.  Players will dodge giant hammers, bounce on the iconic giant balls, dodge swinging or turning beams, manage balancing acts, and other events. \n \nThe main draw of the game is it's focus on motion controls, especially with the Xbox 360, Playstation 3, and Wii versions, using Kinect, Move, and the Wii Remote respectively.  The Xbox 360 version also features different character models than the other retail versions as they are designed around the style of Xbox 360 Avatars, and players are able to use their own Avatar in-game, as well as snapshots taken during gameplay. \n \nThe game also features replays, a Practice mode, and a behind-the-scenes video.",
